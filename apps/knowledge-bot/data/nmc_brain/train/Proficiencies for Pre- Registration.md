## Examples of Suggested Method of Assessment

Accompanying each proficiency is some examples of potential / suggested methods of assessment that could be utilised to evidence the completion of a specific proficiency. For some proficiencies, there may only be one method of assessment. For example: "Demonstrates effective hand washing" can only be completed using direct observation, which is due to the nature of the skill being assessed. However, for some, there are various ways to evidence completion of the proficiency. Alternatively, it may be useful to consider a spoke placement if there is limited exposure to the proficiency in the practice learning environment.

The various methods of assessment include:

- Direct observation
- Demonstration of proficiency through discussion
- Simulation
- Spoke placement / Training opportunity
- Feedback

### Guidance for the supervision of student nurses enrolled on programmes governed by the NMC 2018 Standards of Education, specifically regarding the invasive clinical skills

**Click the tabs below:**

**1\. Introduction**

The document contains information for the supervision of student nurses relating to the to NMC (2018) Standards Framework for Nursing and Midwifery Education and the NMC (2018) Standards of Proficiency for Registered Nurses including Skills Annexe B. Student Nurses on the NMC (2018) Standards are required to demonstrate a wide range of skills according to their level of ability and the context of care. These skills are not included in the NMC (2010) Standards of Pre-Registration education. The potential risk involved in practicing the identified high risk invasive clinical skills must be acknowledged and mitigated in practice to safeguard patients.

[Introduction](#_bookmark0)

- Overarching principles to supervision of students
  - It is the responsibility of the supervising registered health professional with occupational competence to discuss with the nursing student the clinical skill or proficiency being assessed / supervised. This should include whether it is an appropriate learning opportunity based on holistic patient care, consent and safety.
  - The supervising registered healthcare professional must include the skill/proficiency within their usual and ongoing scope of practice
  - Student nurses are supernumerary and should be supported to achieve the proficiencies in practice learning environments which could include spoking to alternative areas or fields or simulating the proficiency.
  - All student nurses need supervision to have their assessment documentation completed in a timely manner. Their documentation will indicate the relevant Standards. If a proficiency has not

been assessed, please leave the signature blank to avoid signing "not achieved" when this has not been assessed as this could imply that nursing students have not passed the proficiency.

- 1. The decision to involve the student in the invasive clinical skill will depend on the context of the clinical / practice situation, the readiness of the student and the professional judgement of the Practice Supervisor / Practice Assessor. Students are required to have completed the theoretical component within University or agreed workshop / training opportunity, prior to attempting an invasive skill in practice areas. However, this should not limit the learner's ability to gain knowledge of policies and procedures regarding these invasive clinical skills through observation, training or learning opportunities.

- **Direct and Indirect Supervision**
  - Direct supervision is defined as: 'In the immediate presence and under the constant observation of a registered practitioner who is competent within the skill themselves and is able to assess student ability and performance. The registered practitioner must always be in a position to stop the student at any point if deemed necessary.
  - All students must be under the supervision of a registered nurse or other registered healthcare professional at all times. They must evidence theoretical achievement and demonstrate competency in that skill under direct supervision. Direct supervision is essential for high-risk invasive clinical skills and medication administration.
  - The level of supervision a student requires in all other proficiencies is based on the professional judgement of their supervisors, considering any associated risks and the students' knowledge, proficiency and confidence and in accordance with the programme requirements and local policy.
  - Other skills listed in the NMC (2018) Standards of Proficiency for Registered Nurses including Skills Annexe B should be managed in accordance with the principles listed in points above an[d](#_bookmark7) below

### Guidance for the supervision of student nurses enrolled on programmes governed by the NMC 2018 Standards of Education, specifically regarding the invasive clinical skills

- - 1. Students' Responsibility
            -  It is imperative that students are aware of their current level of competency and only accept delegated tasks for which they have proven competence. They must act under supervision in accordance with their university practice.
            -  Nursing students should have completed the theory underpinning the proficiency prior to practicing this under supervision, particularly the proficiencies considered to be invasive and in accordance with local policy.
            -  Student nurses must demonstrate skills according to the NMC Code Professional standards of practice and behaviour for nurses, midwives and nursing associates (2018) <https://www.nmc.org.uk/globalassets/sitedocuments/nmc-publications/nmc-code.pdf> and in accordance with law, relevant local policy and procedure
        - Seconded and Apprentice Students
            - Seconded or Apprentice Nursing students have substantive posts in the Trust as Health Care Support Workers (HCSW, Band 3 with NVQ level 3 or equivalent, support worker) or Band 4 Assistant Practitioners (AP) roles and may already be proficient in a particular skill, e.g. phlebotomy. Before this skill can be carried out whilst in their student role, training and competency in this skill must be achieved and evidenced and they must continue to work under direct supervision and in accordance with local policy.
        - Competency
            - Passing the proficiency once, in one placement does not necessarily mean that a nursing student's proficiency, in that clinical skill, can be continuously assumed, especially

when proficiency demands continuity of practice and ongoing review.

- - - 1. In regard to the proficiencies that are more invasive, nursing students must always perform the identified clinical skills under direct supervision, even after passing the related proficiency. Ongoing direct supervision is intended to enable students to develop and sustain confidence and proficiency over time whilst being exposed to a range of often complex learning situations and scenarios and must be conducted in line with local policy.
            - The Grade Descriptors are 'Yes' (This proficiency has been achieved), 'No' (this proficiency has not been achieved). If any proficiency can not be assessed or is not applicable

to the practice area please leave blank.

[Terminology](#_bookmark82)

- **Will students be required to achieve the proficiencies and procedures within all fields of practice?**
  - The NMC state the following: The proficiencies specify the knowledge and skills that registered nurses must demonstrate when caring for people of all ages and across all care settings. There's no expectation that the proficiencies must be demonstrated in every health and care setting. Students would normally demonstrate the ability to carry out nursing procedures within their own field of nursing practice. Where opportunities are limited in a particular field of practice, they may be demonstrated in any appropriate context or setting.

##### Spoke Opportunities

**Click the tabs below:**

Utilising spoke opportunities during placement periods can be a very effective way of enhancing learning experiences. This being with regards gaining increased knowledge and exposure to a patient journey and the context of local service delivery and provision.

Utilising spoke placements can also support the development of knowledge and skills in relation to proficiencies. This being specifically with regards to proficiencies that may be difficult to achieve due to the opportunities of exposure, within the learners allocated placement area.

For example, a learner placed within a nurse-led clinic, may not have the opportunity to gain exposure to proficiencies regarding end-of-life care. So a spoke within a bereavement team or with a palliative care specialist nurse, would support learning and development.

Spoke placements can be useful to if there is limited exposure to a proficiency in a specific field of nursing. For example; a .or . nursing student may arrange an "out of field" spoke placement to gain access to and participate in the care for a patient requiring urethral catheterisation (under direction supervision) if exposure is limited in their current practice learning environment.

Learners should be proactive, in terms of identifying possible spoke opportunities in discussion with their practice assessor. From this, learners should liaise with appropriate Practice education facilitators/services and / or colleagues in order to arrange the desired spoke learning opportunity.

Spoke opportunities could range from half a day to a week, depending on the nature of the opportunity and capacity of the area / individual to accommodate the learner.

Accountability/Signing of PAD

If a learner has or can provide evidence to the Practice Supervisors and/or Practice Assessor that, at that time, confirms to them the learning has been achieved and they document this in the relevant documentation (PAD) then there is clear evidence base for the decision of the Practice Assessor. If a learner then, at a later date, demonstrates poor professionalism (or anything else against the Code) then it is not the accountability of the Practice Assessor as they have clear documented evidence their assessment was appropriate at that time.

Assessment responsibilities

Each practice assessor is responsible for the assessment and confirmation of the achievement of proficiencies and programmes outcomes in practice learning for the student(s) they are assigned to, for the period they are assigned to them. A good assessment is evidenced based, objective and fair, taking into account a variety of views and inputs, and student diversity, such as different learning styles, cultural backgrounds and communication styles. The practice

assessor should take into account the student's history of achievement and their achievement across theory and practice. Assessment should be continuous throughout the time in which a practice assessor is assigned to a student. The practice assessor should be up to date on the progress of the student they are assigned to; collation of information on a student's performance should be managed in a way that enables this. Feedback to the student about their achievement and collaborating with them to review possible areas for improvement also forms a fundamental part of the assessment process. We do this via the PAD/OAR.

When contributing to the recommendation for progression practice assessors should take into account the student's achievement over the whole period for which they are making the decision, e.g. a placement or a year. They should also consider the student's achievement in previous parts of the programme (if any) and how they have progressed over the programme.

Once they have assessed the student's practice learning for the placement(s) they are assigned to the student, they should ensure that there is a proper handover to the next practice assessor, and any other relevant people involved in the education of the student. This includes ensuring that all relevant documentation is up to date, and any particular issues with the student's performance have been recorded or communicated with the next practice assessor and all relevant people.

## Proficiencies

During assessment, it is important that consideration is given to proficiencies. However, proficiencies do not operate as stand alone assessments, pre-registration learners may in fact demonstrate a range of proficiencies within a given nursing intervention.

For example, a Second Year / year two learner completing a **Nursing Discharge**

In participating in or completing agreed learning opportunities with regards to safe discharge and transition in practice, while also demonstrating knowledge and understanding, the learner could within this demonstrate a number of other proficiencies. This being representative of the role of nurse, in utilising a number of skills to facilitate positive outcomes for service delivery, patient experience and health outcomes.

Those procedures outlined in Annexe B, Part I: Procedures for assessing needs for person-centred care, sections 1 and 2 also apply to all registered nurses, but the level of expertise and knowledge required will vary depending on the chosen field(s) of practice. Registered nurses must therefore be able to demonstrate the ability to undertake these procedures at an appropriate level for their intended field(s) of practice.

Those procedures outlined in Annexe B, Part I: Procedures for assessing needs for person-centred care, sections 1 and 2 also apply to all registered nurses, but the level of expertise and knowledge required will vary depending on the chosen field(s) of practice. Registered nurses must therefore be able to demonstrate the ability to undertake these procedures at an appropriate level for their intended field(s) of practice.

Those procedures outlined in Annexe B, Part I: Procedures for assessing needs for person-centred care, sections 1 and 2 also apply to all registered nurses, but the level of expertise and knowledge required will vary depending on the chosen field(s) of practice. Registered nurses must therefore be able to demonstrate the ability to undertake these procedures at an appropriate level for their intended field(s) of practice.

### Supervision and Assessment - Terminology

Supervision and Assessment

- Student assessments are evidence based, robust and objective. Assessments and confirmation of proficiency are based on an understanding of student achievements across theory and practice. Assessments and confirmation of proficiency are timely, providing assurance of student achievements and competence.

Assessment Methods

Reasonable adjustments

There are many methods to assess a student's proficiency/competence.

- Simulation - see below.
- Practical assessment - involves a PS/PA observing a student undertaking a set task or a series of set tasks in a simulated environment for example at an AEI, training provider or specialist centre.
- Observation - involves a PS/PA observing a student undertaking a task or series of tasks in the learning environment. This should be complemented by questioning from the PS/PA during or/and after the observation. Observational assessment is deemed the most appropriate assessment method for practical skills; by watching the student complete a task, they can demonstrate their competence.
- Discussion - A professional discussion can a communication between PSs, PAs, student and/or AA to assess the student's in-depth understanding of their work and clinical performance. This is not an interview! There should be more interaction and discussion than a Q&A scenario.
- Another professional's feedback - receiving feedback from colleagues is a good way to get a 360-degree view of a student's

performance so PAs should seek and consider other colleagues' feedback on a student's performance of skills, knowledge, attitude and values. If you think of when you receive a handover of a patient from colleagues, then you should treat the information being past to you about a student the same.

- Presentation and questioning - A presentation involves a student presenting to PS/PA or a staff group on a particular topic. It can be followed by a questioning session from PS/PA or group. This maybe a good way to continue to make sure your learning environment is working to the latest evidence-based practices.
- Project work - Using a project as an assessment method involves the student completing an appropriate and defined piece of work. This could involve a written project e.g., patient friendly guidance or information leaflets. The project should be reviewed by the

PS/PA The project should be designed to ensure that the student's work meets the needs of the assessment and is relevant to their role and allows the relevant outcomes to be demonstrated for their assessment document. Therefore, the project's subject and scope should be agreed between the PS, PA and student.

- Coaching - Coaching should empower students. It is about students being allowed to take more responsibility for their learning. A coaching model supports this, and PS/PA should, where possible and appropriate, utilise a coaching framework to enable the student to identify solutions to practice-based problems in a safe environment.
- Where a student requires a specific amendment to their practice related to a disability or adjustment relating to any protected characteristics as set out in the equalities and human rights legislation.
