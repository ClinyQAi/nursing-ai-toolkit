## Abstract

The digitisation of healthcare presents both opportunities and challenges for the nursing profession. Whilst digital technologies promise improved efficiency and patient outcomes, nurses are often excluded from technology design and development, leading to systems that fail to meet clinical needs (While and Dewsbury, 2023). This paper presents the Nurse Citizen Developer Framework, a structured approach for enabling registered nurses to actively participate in the design, development, and governance of digital healthcare solutions. Drawing on current literature from nursing informatics and digital health policy (Stevens and Palfreyman, 2024; NHS England, 2023), the framework outlines five core principles, five developmental pillars, and four progressive competency levels. It aligns with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Code (2018) and addresses the growing need for nursing involvement in artificial intelligence (AI) governance. This framework contributes to the emerging discourse on digital nursing practice and offers practical guidance for nurses, educators, and healthcare organisations seeking to develop digital capability within the nursing workforce.

**Key words:** digital nursing, citizen development, nursing informatics, artificial intelligence, healthcare technology, professional development

## Executive Summary

The **Nurse Citizen Developer Framework** provides a structured approach for enabling registered nurses to actively participate in the design, development, and governance of digital healthcare solutions. Moving beyond the traditional role of technology consumers, this framework positions nurses as essential partners in shaping the tools that support patient care.

This framework addresses the growing gap between clinical needs and technological solutions by equipping nurses with the skills, knowledge, and mindset to bridge these domains. It aligns with professional standards, promotes patient safety, and advances health equity through inclusive technology development.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Case for Nurse Citizen Development

Healthcare is undergoing unprecedented digital transformation. The NHS Long Term Plan committed to achieving 100% electronic health record coverage by March 2025, with 80% of adult social care providers utilising digital care records by March 2024 (Department of Health and Social Care, 2023). This digitisation has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated rapid adoption of remote consultations, digital monitoring, and virtual care pathways (Booth et al., 2023).

Yet despite being the largest healthcare workforce and the professionals with the most patient contact, nurses have historically been excluded from technology design and development (Topol, 2019). Cassano-Piché et al. (2023) note that this exclusion has significant consequences:

- Technologies that do not fit clinical workflows
- Increased documentation burden
- Alert fatigue and workarounds
- Systems that embed bias or fail diverse populations
- Loss of professional autonomy to algorithmic decision-making

The British Journal of Nursing has highlighted the tension between the empathetic, human-centric ethos of nursing and the perceived impersonal nature of digital technology (Stevens and Palfreyman, 2024).

### 1.2 What is a Citizen Developer?

A **Citizen Developer** is a professional who creates applications, automates workflows, or builds technology solutions without formal software engineering training. In healthcare, this means clinicians using low-code/no-code platforms, AI tools, and digital skills to solve problems in their practice environment (NHS Berkshire Healthcare, 2024).

A **Nurse Citizen Developer** specifically refers to registered nurses who:
- Use technology tools to improve patient care and workflows
- Design and prototype digital solutions for clinical problems
- Participate in the governance and evaluation of healthcare AI
- Advocate for responsible, person-centred technology

### 1.3 Alignment with Professional Standards

This framework aligns with the NMC Code (2018), which requires nurses to:
- 'Always practise in line with the best available evidence' (6.1)
- 'Be aware of, and reduce as far as possible, any potential for harm' (19.1)
- 'Uphold the reputation of your profession' (20.1)
- 'Facilitate students and colleagues to develop their competence' (9.4)

---

## 2. Core Principles

The Nurse Citizen Developer Framework is built on five core principles, each aligned with contemporary nursing values and the NMC Code (2018):

### 2.1 Person-Centred Technology

> *'Technology should serve people, not the other way around.'*

All technology development must keep the person – whether patient, family, or colleague – at the centre. This aligns with the Foundation of Nursing Studies (FONS) approach to person-centred practice development (Bosanquet et al., 2022). This means:
- Involving patients and carers in design processes
- Prioritising accessibility and inclusivity
- Preserving human connection and professional judgement
- Ensuring technology enhances rather than replaces compassionate care

As Stevens and Palfreyman (2024) observe, there is a risk that digital technologies may depersonalise care; the Nurse Citizen Developer must actively work to prevent this outcome.

### 2.2 Professional Accountability

> *'With the power to build comes the responsibility to build safely.'*

The NMC Code (2018) requires nurses to work within their scope of competence and to acknowledge the limits of their knowledge. Nurse Citizen Developers maintain their professional accountability by:
- Working within their scope of competence
- Seeking appropriate oversight and collaboration
- Documenting and evaluating their solutions
- Escalating concerns about AI safety or bias
- Never deploying untested solutions in clinical settings

The NHS clinical safety standards DCB0129 and DCB0160 provide frameworks for ensuring digital solutions are implemented safely (NHS Digital, 2023).

### 2.3 Transparent Iteration

> *'We learn as much from failure as from success.'*

The framework embraces honest, iterative development, drawing on the tradition of practice development within nursing (McCormack and McCance, 2017):
- Sharing both successes and failures openly
- Documenting lessons learnt for collective benefit
- Treating negative results as valuable contributions
- Building on the work of others respectfully

### 2.4 Equity and Inclusion

> *'Technology must work for everyone, not just the majority.'*

Nurse Citizen Developers actively work to address health inequalities through technology design (Kariwo, 2023):
- Identify and mitigate algorithmic bias
- Ensure solutions work across diverse populations
- Consider accessibility for people with disabilities
- Address health inequalities through technology design

### 2.5 Continuous Learning

> *'The digital landscape evolves; so must we.'*

The field of healthcare technology changes rapidly. The Royal College of Nursing (2024) highlights programmes such as the Topol Digital Fellowship, which supports clinical staff in developing specialist digital skills:
- Commit to ongoing professional development in digital skills
- Stay informed about emerging technologies and risks
- Participate in communities of practice
- Share knowledge with colleagues and students

## 5. Implementation Methodology

### 5.1 The LEARN-BUILD-SHARE Cycle

The Nurse Citizen Developer approach follows a continuous cycle, reflecting the iterative nature of practice development (McCormack and McCance, 2017):

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │    LEARN    │
        │  ─────────  │
        │ Develop new │
        │   skills    │
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
               ▼
        ┌─────────────┐
        │    BUILD    │
        │  ─────────  │
        │   Create    │
        │  solutions  │
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
               ▼
        ┌─────────────┐
        │    SHARE    │
        │  ─────────  │
        │ Document &  │
        │  teach      │
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
               └──────► (back to LEARN)
```

**LEARN:** Acquire new knowledge and skills through courses, experimentation, and community engagement. Draw on resources from NHS Digital Academy, Health Education England, and professional bodies such as the Faculty of Clinical Informatics (2023).

**BUILD:** Apply learning by creating practical solutions that address real clinical problems.

**SHARE:** Document work openly, teach others, and contribute to the collective knowledge base. Where projects do not succeed, document lessons learnt – these are equally valuable contributions.

### 5.2 Project Selection Criteria

When choosing projects, Nurse Citizen Developers should consider:

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Impact** | Will this improve patient care or staff wellbeing? |
| **Feasibility** | Can I build this with available tools and time? |
| **Safety** | What are the risks if this fails? |
| **Scope** | Is this appropriately sized for my skills? |
| **Support** | Do I have access to guidance and oversight? |
| **Learning** | Will this develop my skills further? |

### 5.3 Safety Guardrails

All Nurse Citizen Developer projects must adhere to safety guardrails, aligned with NHS clinical safety standards (NHS Digital, 2023) and the NMC Code (2018):

1. **Never deploy untested solutions in clinical settings**
2. **Always have human oversight for AI outputs**
3. **Document limitations and failure modes**
4. **Obtain appropriate approvals and governance**
5. **Protect patient data and confidentiality**
6. **Work within your scope of competence**

---

## 9. Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Nursing FunctionGemma

**Problem:** Nurses spend significant time on manual EPR documentation.

**Approach:** A Nurse Citizen Developer fine-tuned a medical LLM (MedGemma) using QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023) to convert natural language clinical notes into structured function calls (Gombedza, 2024).

**Training Details:**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base Model | google/medgemma-4b-it |
| Method | QLoRA (4-bit quantisation) |
| Training Examples | 550 |
| Epochs | 8 |
| Final Training Loss | 0.077 |

**Outcome:** Whilst fine-tuning achieved low training loss (0.077), the model failed to extract values during inference. Pivoting to Gemini API native function calling achieved 94% accuracy. The project was documented openly, contributing to collective learning.

**Learning:** Transparent failure documentation is as valuable as success. Alternative approaches may outperform initial assumptions.

---

### Case Study 2: Person-Centred Language Checker

**Problem:** Healthcare documentation often uses stigmatising or non-person-centred language (Kariwo, 2023).

**Approach:** A nurse developed an AI tool that checks clinical text for stigmatising language and suggests person-centred alternatives.

**Outcome:** The tool identifies terms like 'non-compliant' and suggests alternatives like 'finding it difficult to follow treatment plan.'

**Learning:** AI can support professional values when thoughtfully designed by clinicians.

---

### Case Study 3: NMC Standards Search

**Problem:** Nurses need quick access to NMC Code and standards during practice.

**Approach:** A nurse built a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that answers questions about NMC standards with cited sources.

**Outcome:** Deployed as a Hugging Face Space, enabling accessible guidance on professional standards.

**Learning:** Combining AI with authoritative knowledge sources creates valuable clinical decision support.

---

## 12. Discussion

The Nurse Citizen Developer Framework addresses a significant gap in current approaches to healthcare digital transformation. Whilst considerable attention has been given to workforce upskilling in digital literacy (Health Education England, 2023), less focus has been placed on positioning nurses as active creators of technology solutions.

Concerns about technology depersonalising care (O'Connor et al., 2023) are addressed through the framework's emphasis on person-centred technology and the requirement for human oversight. By positioning nurses as the designers – rather than merely users – of digital solutions, the framework helps ensure that technology remains aligned with nursing values.

The framework also responds to calls for nursing involvement in AI governance (Johnson et al., 2024). As AI systems increasingly influence clinical decision-making, nursing scrutiny is essential to identify bias, ensure safety, and maintain professional accountability.

---

## 13. Limitations

This framework represents a proposed model rather than an evaluated intervention. Empirical research is needed to assess implementation feasibility and outcomes. The framework draws primarily on UK policy and literature; adaptation may be required for other healthcare systems. The rapid pace of technological change means that specific tools and platforms referenced may evolve; the principles and competencies, however, should remain relevant.

---

## 14. Conclusion

The Nurse Citizen Developer Framework represents a call to action for the nursing profession. As healthcare becomes increasingly digital, nurses must move from being passive consumers of technology to active participants in its creation and governance.

This is not about turning nurses into software engineers. It is about recognising that nurses bring unique, essential perspectives to healthcare technology – perspectives rooted in patient care, professional ethics, and clinical judgement that cannot be replicated by developers alone (Topol, 2019).

By embracing the principles, developing across the five pillars, and engaging in the LEARN-BUILD-SHARE cycle, nurses can ensure that the digital future of healthcare is person-centred, safe, equitable, and truly serves the needs of those we care for.

As the International Council of Nurses (2024) observes, digital health technologies offer transformative potential for patient care. Realising this potential requires nursing involvement at every stage – from design through implementation to governance.

**The future of nursing is digital. Let us build it together.**
