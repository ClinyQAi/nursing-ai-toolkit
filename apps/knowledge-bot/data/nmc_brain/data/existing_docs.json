Overarching principles to supervision of students 2.1 It is the responsibility of the supervising registered health professional with occupational competence to discuss with the nursing student the clinical skill or proficiency being assessed / supervised. This should include whether it is an appropriate learning opportunity based on holistic patient care, consent and safety.\n\n2.2 The supervising registered healthcare professional must include the skill/proficiency within their usual and ongoing scope of practice\n\n2.3 Student nurses are supernumerary and should be supported to achieve the proficiencies in practice learning environments which could include spoking to alternative areas or fields or simulating the proficiency.\n\n2.4 All student nurses need supervision to have their assessment documentation completed in a timely manner. Their documentation will indicate the relevant Standards. If a proficiency has not been assessed, please leave the signature blank to avoid signing \u201cnot achieved\u201d when this has not been assessed as this could imply that nursing students have not passed the proficiency."

Students are required to have completed the theoretical component within University or agreed workshop / training opportunity, prior to attempting an invasive skill in practice areas. However, this should not limit the learner's ability to gain knowledge of policies and procedures regarding these invasive clinical skills through observation, training or learning opportunities.\n\n3. Direct and Indirect Supervision 3.1 Direct supervision is defined as: \u2018In the immediate presence and under the constant observation of a registered practitioner who is competent within the skill themselves and is able to assess student ability and performance.

This being specifically with regards to proficiencies that may be difficult to achieve due to the opportunities of exposure, within the learners allocated placement area.\n\nFor example, a learner placed within a nurse-led clinic, may not have the opportunity to gain exposure to proficiencies regarding end-of-life care. So a spoke within a bereavement team or with a palliative care specialist nurse, would support learning and development.\n\nSpoke placements can be useful to if there is limited exposure to a proficiency in a specific field of nursing. For example; a .or . nursing student may arrange an \u201cout of field\u201d spoke placement to gain access to and participate in the care for a patient requiring urethral catheterisation (under direction supervision) if exposure is limited in their current practice learning environment."

A good assessment is evidenced based, objective and fair, taking into account a variety of views and inputs, and student diversity, such as different learning styles, cultural backgrounds and communication styles. The practice assessor should take into account the student\u2019s history of achievement and their achievement across theory and practice. Assessment should be continuous throughout the time in which a practice assessor is assigned to a student. The practice assessor should be up to date on the progress of the student they are assigned to; collation of information on a student\u2019s performance should be managed in a way that enables this. Feedback to the student about their achievement and collaborating with them to review possible areas for improvement also forms a fundamental part of the assessment process. We do this via the PAD/OAR."

This should be complemented by questioning from the PS/PA during or/and after the observation. Observational assessment is deemed the most appropriate assessment method for practical skills; by watching the student complete a task, they can demonstrate their competence.\n\nAssessment Methods\n\nDiscussion - A professional discussion can a communication between PSs, PAs, student and/or AA to assess the student\u2019s in-depth understanding of their work and clinical performance. This is not an interview! There should be more interaction and discussion than a Q&A scenario."

If you think of when you receive a handover of a patient from colleagues, then you should treat the information being past to you about a student the same.\n\nPresentation and questioning - A presentation involves a student presenting to PS/PA or a staff group on a particular topic. It can be followed by a questioning session from PS/PA or group. This maybe a good way to continue to make sure your learning environment is working to the latest evidence-based practices."

Therefore, the project\u2019s subject and scope should be agreed between the PS, PA and student.\n\nCoaching - Coaching should empower students. It is about students being allowed to take more responsibility for their learning. A coaching model supports this, and PS/PA should, where possible and appropriate, utilise a coaching framework to enable the student to identify solutions to practice-based problems in a safe environment.\n\nReasonable adjustments\n\nWhere a student requires a specific amendment to their practice related to a disability or adjustment relating to any protected characteristics as set out in the equalities and human rights legislation.\n\nI\n\n.: Proficiencies (Part /\n\nYear One)"

They are not nurses; nursing is a graduate entry profession and those joining the nursing part of the NMC register require a degree. Nurses also develop additional skills and knowledge within a specific field of nursing.\n\nNursing associates are a new profession, accountable for their practice. These proficiencies set out what pre-registration training will equip nursing associates to know, and do. Once they are practising, nursing associates can undertake further education and training and demonstrate additional knowledge and skills, enhancing their competence as other registered professionals routinely do. The roles played by nursing associates will vary from setting to setting, depending on local clinical frameworks, and it may also be shaped by national guidance."

They work in the context of continual change, challenging environments, different models of care delivery, shifting demographics, innovation and rapidly evolving technologies.

It is crucial to use them correctly 1:\n\n\"Yes\" \u2013 Proficiency achieved: This indicates the student has been assessed and has demonstrated the required standard of proficiency for their Part of the programme. \u25cf \"No\" \u2013 Proficiency not yet achieved: This indicates the student has been assessed but has not met the required standard. This grade must be supported by feedback and a\n\nclear action plan to address the deficit."

While the core proficiencies define the standard for registration, the level of performance expected progresses significantly at each stage. This toolkit defines this progression as follows:\n\nPart / Year 1: Guided participation in care and performing with increasing\n\nconfidence. \u25cb Focus on foundational knowledge, performing fundamental skills under supervision,\n\nand beginning to apply person-centred communication.1\n\nPart / Year 2: Active participation in care with minimal guidance and performing\n\nwith increased confidence and competence. \u25cb Focus on more independent assessment, managing more complex episodes of care,"

Here they should confirm they believe themselves to be competent and ready for assessment. The assessor will then document their findings. Competent will be documented as Yes Not competent as No All episodes of assessment should be documented in order to evidence the nature and extent of support and supervision provided in achieving a skill and to provide direction in performance management if repeated assessments are unsuccessful. Formative assessment is used to assess levels of competence after an opportunity of learning. It will provide feedback as to what gaps remain in order to plan further development. Formative assessment is an important step for the learner and assessor to reach a shared understanding of needs and next steps. If the learner is deemed Competent at first assessment there may not be a need for further documented assessment although some clinical skills in particular may be beneficial to assess twice if there is likely to be variations in performance or adaptions required to perform the same skill in a different situation."

Summative assessment provides a conclusion to an episode of learning and skill acquisition. Both learner and assessor are required to report \u2018Yes\u2019 in order for the individual to be deemed competent in this skill. Skills have been written as singular stand alone skills that can be completed in a progressive and positive way rather than in a detailed description encompassing all knowledge, and a variety of clinical skills in relation to 1 area of competence.

There is a variety in the length of supervisory periods given to nursing staff new to this specialty depending on which Paediatric Critical Care Unit they work and the previous clinical experience. This is the basic level of competence expected before independent practice. However, some units will make adaptions in the way that supervision is provided with concepts such as \u2018team Nursing\u2019 or \u2018Pod Nursing\u2019 beyond the supernumerary period.

A good assessment is evidenced based, objective and fair, taking into account a variety of views and inputs, and student diversity, such as different learning styles, cultural backgrounds and communication styles. The practice assessor should take into account the student\u2019s history of achievement and their achievement across theory and practice. Assessment should be continuous throughout the time in which a practice assessor is assigned to a student. The practice assessor should be up to date on the progress of the student they are assigned to; collation of information on a student\u2019s performance should be managed in a way that enables this. Feedback to the student about their achievement and collaborating with them to review possible areas for improvement also forms a fundamental part of the assessment process.

Practice educators should work with university disability support and follow local policies to implement adjustments.

In Part 1 (Year 1), students participate in care under close guidance, focusing on fundamental skills and building confidence. By Part 2 (Year 2), students take a more active role in care with minimal guidance, performing skills with increased confidence and competence[6]. In Part 3 (Year 3), students should be practising independently with minimal supervision and leading and coordinating care with confidence[7]. This staged progression reflects the increasing complexity of proficiencies: Year 1 emphasizes core skills (communication, basic assessments, personal care, infection control, etc.), Year 2 adds more complex skills (clinical decision-making, managing care for multiple patients, some invasive procedures under supervision), and Year 3 focuses on leadership (team coordination, delegation, autonomous decision-making, and handling complex or rapidly changing situations).

The procedures in Annexe B are divided into sections (often referred to as Part 1 and Part 2 of Annexe B). Importantly, Annexe B procedures are additional to the main proficiency statements \u2013 they support and underpin the proficiencies but are not proficiencies in themselves[8].

Some procedures that are more common in other fields (e.g. care of a child or mental health specific interventions) are still required knowledge, but adult students would demonstrate them at an appropriate level for adult care[12][13]. Conversely, students from other fields might fulfill adult-oriented procedures through simulation or spoke placements. For example, an adult nursing student needs to understand mental health interventions (like de-escalation techniques or cognitive therapies) and may encounter these if an adult patient has those needs, but they are not expected to become expert mental health clinicians \u2013 just competent to recognize and support those needs or seek help appropriately[14].

    "content": "Suggestive Methods of Assessment\n\nProficiencies can be demonstrated and assessed in various ways. The following methods are commonly used, often in combination, to gather evidence that a student has achieved a given outcome. Deciding which method is appropriate depends on the nature of the skill or knowledge, as well as opportunities available in the placement. The student\u2019s Practice Assessor will make the final assessment decision, informed by evidence from these methods.\n\nDirect Observation: The student performs the skill or task in the practice setting while a registered practitioner observes. This is the most straightforward way to\n\nassess many clinical skills. For example, a student\u2019s hand hygiene technique or blood pressure measurement should be assessed by directly watching them do it[17]. Direct observation provides first-hand evidence and can be supplemented by questions to confirm understanding (the \u201cunderpinning knowledge\u201d). A proficiency demonstrated via direct observation is considered achieved once the observer (e.g. a nurse) confirms the student performed it safely and effectively[18][19]. This method is ideal for technical and interpersonal skills."

    "content": "Demonstration through Discussion: The student explains, describes or answers questions about how they would perform a skill or handle a scenario, drawing on knowledge and maybe past experiences. This method is useful when actual performance opportunities are limited or when probing the student\u2019s depth of understanding. For instance, a student might discuss how they would recognise and respond to sepsis, referencing current guidelines, even if they haven\u2019t encountered an septic patient yet. Through professional conversation, including reflective accounts or reference to research and local policy, the student can demonstrate their proficiency in a cognitive sense[20][21]. If using this method, the Practice Supervisor/Assessor should ensure the discussion is robust and scenario- based, and document that the student showed sufficient knowledge to meet the outcome."

    "id": 782,
    "content": "Simulation: Simulation involves re-creating clinical scenarios in a controlled environment (or sometimes within the placement) so that the student can practice and be assessed without risk to real patients. This can range from high-fidelity simulations (using manikins or actors in a sim lab) to simple role-play or scenario- based drills. Simulation is recognised by the NMC as a valid way to achieve practice hours and proficiencies, provided it is structured and supervised appropriately[22]. An effective simulation allows for repetition, feedback, and reflection[23]. For proficiency sign-off, a registered practitioner would observe the student\u2019s performance in simulation and assess it as if in real practice[24]. For example, if a placement never encountered a cardiac arrest, a simulation of CPR can be used to demonstrate that proficiency. Simulation is especially helpful for invasive procedures like cannulation or catheterisation if real opportunities are scarce \u2013 the student can show the steps on a manikin to an assessor.

Spoke opportunities also include attending training sessions (e.g. a diabetes pump workshop or moving & handling training) and area-based learning like specialist nurse clinics.

For instance, a patient might provide feedback that a student communicated with empathy and kept them well-informed during their care, which could evidence a communication proficiency. Similarly, a physiotherapist might give feedback that a student proactively assisted in mobility sessions and followed guidance well, evidencing teamwork. Feedback should be documented (e.g. via feedback forms or testimonials) and can corroborate the student\u2019s performance in less directly observable areas like compassion and advocacy[27][28]. While feedback alone may not confirm technical skill, it enriches the evidence, especially when combined with observation or discussion.

Each student is assigned a PA (per placement or per year) who conducts formal assessment meetings and works in partnership with the Academic Assessor to evaluate progress.\n\nAcademic Assessor (AA): A registered nurse in the academic setting (typically a lecturer) who collates and confirms the student\u2019s achievement of proficiencies and academic outcomes for each part of the programme[38]. The AA collaborates with the Practice Assessor to make decisions about progression[48]. A different AA is usually assigned in each year, to maintain objectivity.

In Year 2, the student transitions to greater independence: they are expected to care for a larger workload (e.g., a small patient group) under supervision, start performing more complex skills (some with an asterisk * can be achieved either in Year 2 or deferred to Year 3 if not encountered), and take more initiative in clinical decision-making. Leadership skills begin to develop at this stage (e.g., helping to organise care, teaching peers).
