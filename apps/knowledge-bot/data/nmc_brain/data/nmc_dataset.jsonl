Their documentation will indicate the relevant Standards. If a proficiency has not been assessed, please leave the signature blank to avoid signing \u201cnot achieved\u201d when this has not been assessed as this could imply that nursing students have not passed the proficiency."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "2.5 The decision to involve the student in the invasive clinical skill will depend on the context of the clinical / practice situation, the readiness of the student and the professional judgement of the Practice Supervisor / Practice Assessor. Students are required to have completed the theoretical component within University or agreed workshop / training opportunity, prior to attempting an invasive skill in practice areas. However, this should not limit the learner's ability to gain knowledge of policies and procedures regarding these invasive clinical skills through observation, training or learning opportunities.\n3. Direct and Indirect Supervision 3.1 Direct supervision is defined as: \u2018In the immediate presence and under the constant observation of a registered practitioner who is competent within the skill themselves and is able to assess student ability and performance. The registered practitioner must always be in a position to stop the student at any point if deemed necessary."}

{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Learners are expected to take responsibility for their own learning and commence the assessment process with the self-report column. Here they should confirm they believe themselves to be competent and ready for assessment. The assessor will then document their findings. Competent will be documented as Yes Not competent as No All episodes of assessment should be documented in order to evidence the nature and extent of support and supervision provided in achieving a skill and to provide direction in performance management if repeated assessments are unsuccessful. Formative assessment is used to assess levels of competence after an opportunity of learning. It will provide feedback as to what gaps remain in order to plan further development. Formative assessment is an important step for the learner and assessor to reach a shared understanding of needs and next steps. If the learner is deemed Competent at first assessment there may not be a need for further documented assessment although some clinical skills in particular may be beneficial to assess twice if there is likely to be variations in performance or adaptions required to perform the same skill in a different situation."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "some clinical skills in particular may be beneficial to assess twice if there is likely to be variations in performance or adaptions required to perform the same skill in a different situation. Summative assessment provides a conclusion to an episode of learning and skill acquisition. Both learner and assessor are required to report \u2018Yes\u2019 in order for the individual to be deemed competent in this skill. Skills have been written as singular stand alone skills that can be completed in a progressive and positive way rather than in a detailed description encompassing all knowledge, and a variety of clinical skills in relation to 1 area of competence.

Period of completion and designated supernumerary time are at the discretion of local teams.\nSupervisory Period \u2013 Normally directly supervised by an established Critical Care nurse for a period of time to enable development of the essential skills required to care independently for a child requiring critical care. There is a variety in the length of supervisory periods given to nursing staff new to this specialty depending on which Paediatric Critical Care Unit they work and the previous clinical experience. This is the basic level of competence expected before independent practice. However, some units will make adaptions in the way that supervision is provided with concepts such as \u2018team Nursing\u2019 or \u2018Pod Nursing\u2019 beyond the supernumerary period.

In Part 3 (Year 3), students should be practising independently with minimal supervision and leading and coordinating care with confidence[7]. This staged progression reflects the increasing complexity of proficiencies: Year 1 emphasizes core skills (communication, basic assessments, personal care, infection control, etc.), Year 2 adds more complex skills (clinical decision-making, managing care for multiple patients, some invasive procedures under supervision), and Year 3 focuses on leadership (team coordination, delegation, autonomous decision-making, and handling complex or rapidly changing situations).

The procedures in Annexe B are divided into sections (often referred to as Part 1 and Part 2 of Annexe B). Importantly, Annexe B procedures are additional to the main proficiency statements \u2013 they support and underpin the proficiencies but are not proficiencies in themselves[8].

{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Suggestive Methods of Assessment\nProficiencies can be demonstrated and assessed in various ways. The following methods are commonly used, often in combination, to gather evidence that a student has achieved a given outcome. Deciding which method is appropriate depends on the nature of the skill or knowledge, as well as opportunities available in the placement. The student\u2019s Practice Assessor will make the final assessment decision, informed by evidence from these methods.\nDirect Observation: The student performs the skill or task in the practice setting while a registered practitioner observes. This is the most straightforward way to\nassess many clinical skills. For example, a student\u2019s hand hygiene technique or blood pressure measurement should be assessed by directly watching them do it[17]. Direct observation provides first-hand evidence and can be supplemented by questions to confirm understanding (the \u201cunderpinning knowledge\u201d). A proficiency demonstrated via direct observation is considered achieved once the observer (e.g. a nurse) confirms the student performed it safely and effectively[18][19]. This method is ideal for technical and interpersonal skills."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Demonstration through Discussion: The student explains, describes or answers questions about how they would perform a skill or handle a scenario, drawing on knowledge and maybe past experiences. This method is useful when actual performance opportunities are limited or when probing the student\u2019s depth of understanding. For instance, a student might discuss how they would recognise and respond to sepsis, referencing current guidelines, even if they haven\u2019t encountered an septic patient yet. Through professional conversation, including reflective accounts or reference to research and local policy, the student can demonstrate their proficiency in a cognitive sense[20][21]. If using this method, the Practice Supervisor/Assessor should ensure the discussion is robust and scenario- based, and document that the student showed sufficient knowledge to meet the outcome."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Simulation: Simulation involves re-creating clinical scenarios in a controlled environment (or sometimes within the placement) so that the student can practice and be assessed without risk to real patients. This can range from high-fidelity simulations (using manikins or actors in a sim lab) to simple role-play or scenario- based drills. Simulation is recognised by the NMC as a valid way to achieve practice hours and proficiencies, provided it is structured and supervised appropriately[22]. An effective simulation allows for repetition, feedback, and reflection[23]. For proficiency sign-off, a registered practitioner would observe the student\u2019s performance in simulation and assess it as if in real practice[24]. For example, if a placement never encountered a cardiac arrest, a simulation of CPR can be used to demonstrate that proficiency. Simulation is especially helpful for invasive procedures like cannulation or catheterisation if real opportunities are scarce \u2013 the student can show the steps on a manikin to an assessor.

For instance, a patient might provide feedback that a student communicated with empathy and kept them well-informed during their care, which could evidence a communication proficiency. Similarly, a physiotherapist might give feedback that a student proactively assisted in mobility sessions and followed guidance well, evidencing teamwork. Feedback should be documented (e.g. via feedback forms or testimonials) and can corroborate the student\u2019s performance in less directly observable areas like compassion and advocacy[27][28].

Spoke opportunities are invaluable for broadening a student\u2019s exposure, allowing them to develop skills and insights that the current placement might not offer. They also foster inter-agency and inter-professional awareness, as students often engage with services outside the immediate clinical team. Here\u2019s how to effectively utilize spoke placements:"}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "What is a Spoke? In simple terms, a spoke placement is like a \u201cfield trip\u201d or mini- placement. It can range from a few hours observing a specialist, to a couple of days or a week embedded in another team. The idea is that the student leaves their main placement temporarily to experience another setting that offers learning relevant to their proficiencies. Spokes are typically arranged when a particular proficiency is difficult to achieve in the current placement\u2019s context[25]. For example, an adult nursing student on a general medical ward might arrange a spoke day in the wound care clinic to observe complex dressings, or with the diabetes specialist nurse to learn about insulin pump management, if those opportunities are rare on the ward."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Arranging Spoke Placements: Usually, the student should discuss potential spokes with their Practice Assessor or Supervisor early in the placement. Together, they identify learning needs that the main placement might not meet fully. The student (with support as needed) can then reach out to relevant departments or use established contacts (often via the Practice Education Facilitator or link tutor) to set up the spoke. It\u2019s important to ensure the spoke area is expecting the student and that a supervisor there is identified to orient and supervise the student during the visit. The main placement\u2019s management must also approve (so they know why the student is absent on those days). Many universities and trusts have guidelines for spokes \u2013 some require a short agreement form to be filled, noting the date, location, and objectives of the spoke.

These experiences can enhance skills like assessment and care planning for specific conditions (like chronic wounds or fall risks). - Outpatient or Community Clinics: e.g., a wound clinic (as mentioned), dialysis unit, oncology day unit, or a GP surgery clinic (to see primary care management of adult conditions).

The NMC acknowledges that a nurse\u2019s actions usually demonstrate a combination of knowledge and skills[76]. For example, consider something as routine as a medication round: the student isn\u2019t just \u201cadministering medicine\u201d (procedure) \u2013 they are also communicating with the patient (communication proficiency), performing an assessment (checking patient identity, allergies, understanding), applying pharmacology knowledge (knowledge proficiency), and documenting (record-keeping proficiency). If we artificially split those, we\u2019d miss the bigger picture that the student can coordinate all those aspects in one go."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Assessment in Clusters: Practice Assessors and Supervisors should consider, when planning an assessment, how one situation can tick off multiple proficiencies. This is efficient and realistic. For instance, a student leading a patient discharge planning meeting could be evidencing communication skills, collaborative working, teaching the patient about medications, understanding of referrals, and documentation \u2013 all in that one activity[68][77]. Instead of needing five separate sign-offs, the assessor might observe that discharge process and then sign off five related proficiencies at once, with appropriate commentary."}

During that discharge process, the student will support the patient in making informed choices (Proficiency P1)[78], apply principles of partnership working and respect capacity (P2)[79], provide clear explanations about the patient\u2019s treatment and follow-up (P5, P22)[80][81], ensure documentation like the discharge letter and care plan is accurate (P7)[82], and coordinate with other services for continuity of care (P31)[83]. In doing so, they might also demonstrate leadership and confidence appropriate to a Year 2 level. Instead of viewing P1, P2, P5, P7, P22, P31 as separate unrelated checkboxes, the assessor clusters them around the \u201cdischarge\u201d event. If the student performed well, evidence from that event (like the supervisor\u2019s observation notes, the completed referral form they filled, feedback from the patient or social worker present) can satisfy all those proficiencies.

This single scenario can provide evidence for proficiencies in assessment, infection prevention, patient education, pain management, and documentation. The assessor could cluster these under \u201cManaged complex wound care for Patient X\u201d and sign off multiple items such as: \"Demonstrates person-centred assessment and monitoring of wound healing,\" \"Performs wound dressing using aseptic technique,\" \"Provides effective education to patient and carer,\" \"Evaluates and documents care outcomes.\" Each is a distinct proficiency, but all were met together."}

In that one conversation, the student might demonstrate empathy, ability to adjust communication to the situation, understanding of safeguarding or supporting vulnerable people, and working alongside perhaps a doctor or specialist nurse. A single observed \u201cdifficult conversation\u201d could thus address: communication skills, respecting dignity, recognizing one\u2019s role in the team (knowing when to get senior help), and emotional support measures.

It reinforces to the student how knowledge, skills, and attitudes come together. It also prevents over-assessing the student \u2013 if one situation suffices, there\u2019s no need to set up five separate assessments which can lead to assessment fatigue and redundant paperwork. Clustering is also protective in terms of validity: it shows the student can bring everything together in context, which is ultimately what matters for safe practice.

A scenario like coordinating a complex discharge or managing a deteriorating patient will inherently cover multiple proficiencies (from acute care skills to leadership). For example, a student managing a patient who suddenly becomes hypoxic will use assessment skills (recognize signs), communication (call the doctor, SBAR), technical skills (maybe administer oxygen, do an ECG), and teamwork (allocate someone to reassure family, someone to fetch emergency trolley). If they do this in simulation or real life, an assessor can cluster acute care proficiencies (like \u201crecognize and respond to deterioration,\u201d \u201ceffective communication under pressure,\u201d \u201cteam leadership in emergency,\u201d and \u201cinfection control during emergency interventions\u201d).

{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "In essence, proficiency clustering is about seeing the forest rather than just the trees. It encourages a focus on integrated practice. When planning assessments or writing up evidence, think in terms of patient stories or nursing scenarios and identify the constellation of competencies within them. As one nursing educator aptly said, \u201cNursing is not a checklist; it\u2019s a tapestry of skills woven together.\u201d Clustering helps us evaluate how well students can weave that tapestry. By using this approach, we also prepare students to think comprehensively \u2013 to always consider the whole patient and situation, rather than performing tasks in isolation. This ultimately leads to better, safer care and nurses who are reflective and versatile in their practice.\n(For additional guidance, the NMC\u2019s standards framework encourages integrative assessment approaches and many AEIs provide examples of how multiple outcomes can be met in a single assessment \u2013 leveraging that can simplify the journey for both student and assessor.)\ncentred.\nGlossary of Terms"}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "centred.\nGlossary of Terms\nThroughout this toolkit (and more broadly in nursing education), certain terms and acronyms are used which may be unfamiliar. Below is a glossary of key terms and abbreviations, particularly those related to supervision, assessment, and professional practice:\nPractice Supervisor (PS): A registered nurse, midwife or nursing associate (or other registered health professional) who supervises and supports nursing students on a day-to-day basis in the practice setting. They act as role models and facilitate learning, providing feedback on the student\u2019s progress[95][50]. All qualified nurses are expected to act as supervisors when working with students, helping them to learn while ensuring safe patient care."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Practice Assessor (PA): A registered nurse who is responsible for assessing a nursing student\u2019s achievement of proficiencies and outcomes in practice for a specific part of the programme[56]. The PA makes the final decision on whether proficiencies are met, informed by feedback from Practice Supervisors[49][96]. Each student is assigned a PA (per placement or per year) who conducts formal assessment meetings and works in partnership with the Academic Assessor to evaluate progress.\nAcademic Assessor (AA): A registered nurse in the academic setting (typically a lecturer) who collates and confirms the student\u2019s achievement of proficiencies and academic outcomes for each part of the programme[38]. The AA collaborates with the Practice Assessor to make decisions about progression[48]. A different AA is usually assigned in each year, to maintain objectivity. They ensure theoretical learning and practice performance are both considered."}

(Sometimes still called \u201cHEI\u201d \u2013 Higher Education Institution \u2013 but AEI is the term used when NMC approval is in context.)\nPractice Learning Partners: Organisations that provide placement opportunities for students \u2013 e.g., NHS Trusts, GP practices, community services, independent hospitals. They partner with AEIs to support students in meeting proficiencies[98]. These partners must also meet NMC standards (like having appropriate support and governance for student learning).\nPractice Assessment Document (PAD): The official document (physical or electronic, e.g., OnlinePARE) where students\u2019 practice proficiency outcomes are recorded by supervisors/assessors. It usually includes competency checklists,"}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "feedback sections, reflective logs, and interview records.

Mentioned here for completeness \u2013 midwifery equivalent to PAD, but sometimes nursing uses the term in certain regions if they adopted a similar approach. In an adult nursing context, you\u2019ll mostly hear PAD, but if you see MORA, it\u2019s analogous.\nFormative Assessment: Assessments or feedback opportunities that are developmental and do not count as pass/fail of the placement. Formative learning allows the student to receive input on how to improve without it affecting progression[99]. For example, a midway interview or an early medication round observation might be formative \u2013 highlighting areas to work on before the final (summative) assessment."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Summative Assessment: The formal evaluation at the end of a period which determines if outcomes are achieved (and does count towards progression)[100]. In practice, the final interview where the Practice Assessor signs off competencies is summative \u2013 its result (achieved/not achieved) will decide if the student passes that part. Summative = \u201cfor the record\u201d assessment.\nRetrieval (Re-assessment): If a student fails to achieve certain outcomes by the end of a placement or part, a retrieval period is an opportunity to redo or complete those outcomes. Often a short additional placement or extended time (e.g., 4 weeks maximum) is given for the student to meet the requirements[101]. The AA and PA plan this, and it\u2019s a second chance without having to repeat the entire year, as long as the student succeeds in the retrieval.

Simulation may involve mannequins, role-play, virtual reality, or task trainers. It allows students to practice skills and decision-making in a safe environment[23]. In this toolkit, simulation is also considered an assessment method for certain proficiencies. Good simulation includes briefing and debriefing sessions. High-fidelity sims might simulate an entire patient journey; low-fidelity might be simple skill practice.\nSpoke Placement: A short-duration placement or visit to a clinical area outside of the main (hub) placement. Used to gain experience or skills not available on the hub. For example, during a hospital placement (hub), a day spent with a community nurse team might be a spoke. Spokes help ensure exposure to all necessary proficiencies[25][102]. Sometimes also called \u201calternative\u201d or \u201csupplementary\u201d placement."}

In education, this could mean allowing a dyslexic student to use coloured overlays in documentation or giving extra time to complete written work, or providing assistive technology. In practice, could be adjusting shift patterns for a health reason, or ensuring a wheelchair-accessible environment for a student with mobility issues. These adjustments are required by law (Equality Act 2010 in the UK) so that no student is disadvantaged unfairly.

Good character means having integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness \u2013 essentially being suited to the responsibility of professional practice. Universities assess these at admission (via occupational health, references, DBS checks for criminal record) and throughout (if there are concerns like dishonesty or unprofessional behaviour, it can trigger \u201cfitness to practise\u201d processes). It\u2019s why students must disclose issues and uphold professional behaviour even as students \u2013 because they\u2019re being judged on character continuously.

Knowledge of these resources also helps in job interviews or when transitioning to qualified nurse \u2013 showing that you know where to find information to keep your practice up-to-date (a trait of a self-directed professional). Lastly, don\u2019t forget to complete placement evaluations on platforms like OnlinePARE or university surveys \u2013 these are resources for future improvements, and your feedback could help enhance the learning experience for the next cohort.\nPart 1 (Year 1) \u2013 Guided Participation in Care"}

{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Online Resources\nNote: At the end of Part 3, the expectation is that the student can function safely and effectively as an entry-level registered nurse. They should be capable of managing full patient loads, performing all fundamental skills (and many advanced ones) independently (with support resources available as for any practitioner), making sound clinical decisions, and leading teams in routine care. The examples above depict a high level of initiative and critical thinking. Students will vary in confidence; the role of the Practice Assessor is to ensure by final sign-off that any remaining development needs are minor and will be addressed in preceptorship, not fundamental gaps in competence. The Part 3 student is essentially a team colleague \u2013 requiring minimal prompting \u2013 and the toolkit\u2019s examples aim to prepare them for that role.\n(Remind Part 3 students: always seek help in unfamiliar or high-risk situations; independence does not mean doing everything alone. True competence includes recognizing when to ask for input. This attitude ensures safe practice as they transition to qualified nurse.)"}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Reminder: The actions listed across all years are suggestive and not an exhaustive checklist. Every clinical setting is unique; students and supervisors will find alternative ways to evidence proficiencies. The key is to ensure that by the end of each part \u2013 and certainly by the end of Part 3 \u2013 the student can meet the NMC Standards of Proficiency in a holistic, integrated manner, ready for professional registration.\nClosing Notes and Acknowledgements\nThis comprehensive toolkit, \u201cProficiencies for Adult Nursing,\u201d was authored by Lincoln Gombedza with the aim of supporting students and practice staff in the challenging journey of nursing education. It is intended to be a living document \u2013 one that can be adapted by local education providers and practice partners to fit specific contexts or updated as standards evolve. Users are encouraged to take the framework provided here and make it their own: insert local policies, preferred resources, or area-specific competencies where relevant. The heart of the toolkit is to promote consistency in supporting students to achieve proficiency, while still allowing flexibility for individual learning needs and clinical environments."}
{"instruction": "Explain the NMC standards of proficiency for registered nurses.", "input": "", "output": "Local Adaptation: Feel free to integrate trust-specific guidelines (for example, if your hospital has a unique electronic record training or a particular patient pathway, include that in the relevant section). Add blank lines or tables for local contacts (e.g., who to call for specialist advice, local wound formulary links, etc.). The hope is that this toolkit acts as a solid foundation which each placement area or university can enrich with their own best practices and tools."}

The intent is to cultivate a mindset of lifelong learning, reflective practice, and empowerment. I encourage all students to embrace opportunities, ask questions, and believe in their capacity to grow \u2013 and all supervisors to coach with patience, challenge with kindness, and celebrate progress. Together, through supportive education and practice excellence, we ensure the next generation of nurses is not only proficient but also compassionate and resilient.\nLincoln Gombedza, RN, (Practice Educator and Toolkit Author)\nOn behalf of all contributors and the Adult Nursing Education Community, 2025\n[5] [29] [36] [37] [39] [40] [41] [42] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [57] [65] nmc.org.uk\nhttps://www.nmc.org.uk/globalassets/sitedocuments/standards-of- proficiency/standards-for-student-supervision-and-assessment/print-friendly-student- supervision-assessment.pdf\n[10] [12] [13] [106] [107] nmc.org.uk\nhttps://www.nmc.org.uk/globalassets/sitedocuments/education-standards/future-nurse- proficiencies.pdf"}
