# AI-Educator-Toolkit Constitution
**Governing Principles for Development**

## 1. Clinical & Professional Integrity
*   **UK Context First**: All content MUST be aligned with UK nursing practice, NMC standards (2018), and NHS guidelines.
*   **Patient Safety**: No advice should contradict established clinical safety protocols. Hypothetical scenarios must be clearly marked.
*   **Person-Centred**: Language must be person-centred, inclusive, and respectful (aligned with FONS principles).
*   **Evidence-Based**: All clinical claims must be verifiable or based on current best practice.

## 2. Educational Quality
*   **Multimodal Focus**: Content should actively demonstrate multimodal learning (text, image, audio, video).
*   **Action-Oriented**: Every page should provide actionable advice, prompts, or templates for educators.
*   **Accessibility**: All content must be accessible. Semantically correct HTML/Markdown. Alt text for images.
*   **Clear Learning Outcomes**: Educational sections should state what the learner will gain.

## 3. Responsible AI Use
*   **Transparency**: Clearly label AI-generated content or examples.
*   **Evolution Awareness**: Acknowledge that AI tools change rapidly; focus on principles over specific button-clicks.
*   **Data Privacy**: Emphasize Caldicott Principles and NHS Data Security standards. Never encourage inputting PII into public models.
*   **Attribution**: STRICTLY adhere to CC BY-NC 4.0. Every page must credit the original authors and the adapter.

## 4. Technical Standards
*   **Spec-Driven**: Changes to structure or significant content must start with a specification.
*   **Docusaurus Best Practices**: Use standard Markdown/MDX features (Admonitions, Tabs) over raw HTML where possible.
*   **Clean Code**: Components should be reusable. CSS should be consistent with the design system.
*   **Broken Link Zero-Tolerance**: No dead internal or external links.

## 5. Development Workflow
1.  **Read Constitution**
2.  **Define Spec** (What are we building?)
3.  **Create Plan** (How will we build it?)
4.  **Execute** (Build it)
5.  **Verify** (Check against Spec & Constitution)
