# Specification: Stage 2 Completion (Teaching Section)

## 1. Overview
Complete the remaining pages of the "Teaching with AI" section to provide a comprehensive guide for educators on delivering content, facilitating collaboration, and teaching AI literacy, specifically adapted for nursing.

## 2. User Stories
*   **As a nurse educator**, I want to know how to use GenAI during lectures/seminars so I can make sessions more interactive.
*   **As a student**, I want to know how AI can support my group work without doing the work /for/ me.
*   **As a module leader**, I need specific activities to teach AI literacy to nursing students.

## 3. Pages to Create

### A. `teaching-delivery.md`
*   **Goal**: Explain how GenAI actively supports teaching delivery.
*   **Key Content**:
    *   Socratic questioning with AI.
    *   Real-time "roleplay" with chatbots (e.g., simulating a patient).
    *   Live fact-checking exercises.
*   **Nursing Context**: Simulating a patient with "Chest Pain" for history taking.

### B. `collaborative-learning.md`
*   **Goal**: Strategies for student-AI and student-student-AI collaboration.
*   **Key Content**:
    *   AI as a "Team Member" or "Debater".
    *   "Think-Pair-Share-AI" model.
    *   Risks of "social loafing" with AI.
*   **Nursing Context**: Interdisciplinary team meeting simulation.

### C. `ai-literacy-activities.md`
*   **Goal**: Concrete activities to build the 3 levels of AI literacy (defined in previous section).
*   **Key Content**:
    *   Activity 1: "Critique the Output" (Accuracy).
    *   Activity 2: "Prompt Refinement Relay" (Optimization).
    *   Activity 3: "Ethics Audit" (Responsible Use).
*   **Nursing Context**: Critiquing an AI-generated care plan.
