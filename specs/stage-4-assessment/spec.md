# Specification: Stage 4 (Assessment with AI)

## 1. Overview
Develop the "Assessment with AI" section. The goal is to move educators away from "AI Detection" (which is unreliable) toward "AI-Resilient Assessment" that measures authentic student competency.

## 2. User Stories
*   **As an educator**, I need assessment methods that are harder to cheat on using AI.
*   **As a module leader**, I want to use AI to speed up my marking (formative feedback) without breaching privacy.
*   **As a student**, I want to use AI to check my draft assignment before I submit it.

## 3. Pages to Create

### A. `assessment/index.md`
*   **Goal**: The paradigm shift from "Policing" to "Designing".
*   **Key Concept**: "Process over Product". Assessing *how* the student got the answer, not just the answer.

### B. `assessment/multimodal-assessment.md`
*   **Goal**: Designing assessments that require human-specific skills.
*   **Key Content**:
    *   **Viva Voce (Oral Exams)**: Hard to fake with AI.
    *   **Reflective Video Vlogs**: Students discussing their clinical experiences.
    *   **"Show Your Working"**: Assessments where the student must critique AI output.

### C. `assessment/ai-enabled-feedback.md`
*   **Goal**: Using AI for *Formative* feedback (Assessment FOR Learning).
*   **Key Content**:
    *   **The "Pre-flight Check"**: Students submitting drafts to AI for critique on structure/grammar (not content).
    *   **Rubric Alignment**: asking AI "Does this essay meet the criteria for a Level 5 distinction?".
    *   **Warning**: Never upload student essays to public AI (GDPR breach).

### D. `assessment/nursing-examples.md`
*   **Goal**: Prompt library for generic assessment tasks.
*   **Prompts**:
    *   "Generate a marking rubric for a reflective essay."
    *   "Create 5 Multiple Choice Questions based on this lecture."
    *   "Write a 'model answer' for this assignment so students can see what 'Good' looks like."

## 4. Design Requirements (per Constitution)
*   **Attribution**: Standard CC BY-NC 4.0.
*   **Date**: "Last Updated: December 2025".
*   **Privacy**: STRICT warning against uploading student work to public models.
*   **Policy**: Reference to general university AI policies (generic advice).

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
*   [ ] All 4 pages created in `docs/assessment/`.
*   [ ] Sidebar updated.
*   [ ] "Privacy Warning" on the Feedback page.
