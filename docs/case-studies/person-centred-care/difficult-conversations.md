## Scenario: The Angry Relative
Students feel safest when they can make mistakes without hurting anyone.

## The Prompt (For Rehearsal)

> **Copy and paste this into Gemini 3 / GPT-5:**
>
> "Act as 'David', the son of a patient on my ward.
> **Context**: You visited yesterday and your mother's water jug was empty. You are angry and worried she is being neglected.
> **Goal**: I need to de-escalate the situation, apologize, and explain the plan.
>
> **Rules**:
> *   Start off quite aggressive/upset.
> *   If I use open body language (describe it) and empathy, calm down.
> *   If I get defensive, get angrier.
>
> Let's roleplay. You start."

## Reflection
After the chat, asking the AI:
*"David, based on that conversation, did you feel heard? What was the one thing I said that made you feel better?"*
