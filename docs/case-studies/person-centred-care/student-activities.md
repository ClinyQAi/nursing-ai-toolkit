These activities are designed to help nursing students use GenAI as a tool for developing **person-centred practice**, with a focus on reflection, empathy, and communication.

---

## Activity 1: Roleplay with Empathy

**Objective**: Practice responding to a patient expressing frustration or distress.

**Time**: 20-30 minutes

### Instructions

1.  **Set the Scene**: Use the following prompt to have AI act as a patient:

    ```text
    You are a 72-year-old patient named Margaret who has just been told she needs to stay in hospital for another week due to a post-operative infection. You are frustrated, worried about your cat at home, and feel like no one is listening to you. When I speak to you, respond as Margaret would, expressing your emotions authentically.
    ```

2.  **Engage in Dialogue**: Practice your communication skills by responding to "Margaret". Try to:
    - Acknowledge her feelings.
    - Use open-ended questions.
    - Avoid medical jargon.

3.  **Request Feedback**: After 5-6 exchanges, ask the AI for feedback:

    ```text
    Step out of the role of Margaret. Now, as an expert in person-centred communication, give me feedback on my responses. Were they empathetic? Did I use jargon? How could I have done better?
    ```

4.  **Reflect**: Write a short reflection (200-300 words) on what you learned about person-centred communication.

## Activity 2: Values Translation

**Objective**: Learn to identify and remove institutional jargon from care documentation.

**Time**: 15-20 minutes

### Instructions

1.  **Find a Sample**: Locate a care plan from your clinical placement (anonymised) or use the example below.

    > *Example*: "Patient non-compliant with mobilisation regime. Bed rest maintained. PRN analgesia administered. Will review."

2.  **Use the Prompt**:

    ```text
    I am a nursing student learning about person-centred language. Please rewrite the following care note to be more person-centred, avoiding jargon and focusing on the patient's perspective and goals:

    "Patient non-compliant with mobilisation regime. Bed rest maintained. PRN analgesia administered. Will review."
    ```

3.  **Compare**: Note the differences. The AI might suggest:

    > *Revised*: "Mrs Smith chose to rest today due to pain. We discussed her concerns about mobility and agreed to try a short walk after she receives her pain relief. She is keen to get moving when she feels more comfortable."

4.  **Discuss**: In a group or with a peer, discuss why the revised version is more person-centred.

## Activity 3: The Empathy Mirror

**Objective**: Use AI to reflect on a past interaction and identify opportunities for growth.

**Time**: 25-30 minutes

### Instructions

1.  **Recall an Interaction**: Think of a recent interaction with a patient or service user that didn't go as well as you hoped. Write a brief summary (3-4 sentences).

2.  **Use the Prompt**:

    ```text
    I am a nursing student reflecting on a clinical interaction. Here is a summary of what happened:

    [Paste your summary here]

    Using the Person-Centred Nursing Framework (McCormack & McCance), help me reflect on this interaction. Ask me guiding questions about my own values, the care environment, and the person-centred processes I used (or didn't use). Do not give me answers; help me discover insights myself.
    ```

3.  **Engage in Reflection**: Answer the AI's questions honestly. This is a private exercise for your own learning.

4.  **Summarise**: In your own words, write a short summary of what you would do differently next time.

## Activity 4: Creating a Person-Centred Care Plan

**Objective**: Use AI as a co-pilot to draft a care plan that truly centres the patient.

**Time**: 30-40 minutes

### Instructions

1.  **Gather Information**: You are caring for Mr Jones, a 65-year-old man with Type 2 diabetes and early-stage dementia. He lives alone and is fiercely independent. He has been admitted following a fall.

2.  **Use the Prompt**:

    ```text
    Help me create a person-centred care plan for the following patient. I want the care plan to:
    - Explicitly include the patient's own goals and values.
    - Use accessible, non-jargon language.
    - Address not just his physical needs, but also his emotional, social, and psychological well-being.

    Patient: Mr Jones, 65 years old, Type 2 diabetes, early-stage dementia, admitted after a fall. Lives alone, values his independence highly.
    ```

3.  **Refine**: The AI will generate a draft. Your job is to:
    - **Critically review** it for accuracy.
    - **Add clinical detail** from your textbooks and lectures.
    - **Personalise it** further based on a hypothetical conversation with Mr Jones.

4.  **Submit for Peer Review**: Share your final care plan with a peer for feedback on its person-centredness.

## Reflection Questions

After completing these activities, consider:

1.  How did using AI help (or hinder) your development of person-centred skills?
2.  What are the *limitations* of using AI for empathy and communication practice?
3.  How can you ensure that AI remains a *tool* for reflection, not a replacement for human connection?
