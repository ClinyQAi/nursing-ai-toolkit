## The "Jargon Buster"
We often slip into "Medicalese" without realizing it.

## The Prompt (For Self-Correction)

> **Copy and paste this into Gemini 3 / GPT-5:**
>
> "Review this paragraph I have written for a patient information leaflet about 'Hypertension'.
>
> **Constraint**:
> Identify 3 words that are 'jargon' or frightening.
> Suggest 3 alternative phrases that are:
> 1.  Plain English.
> 2.  Person-centred (empowering, not directive).
> 3.  Suitable for a reading age of 12."

## Example Output
*   **Original**: "Adhere to the medication regime to prevent renal insufficiency."
*   **AI Suggestion**: "Take your tablets every day to keep your kidneys healthy."
