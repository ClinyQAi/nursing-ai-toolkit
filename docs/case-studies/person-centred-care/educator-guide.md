This guide helps nursing educators integrate **person-centred AI** into their teaching, using open-source resources from the Foundation of Nursing Studies (FoNS) and the International Practice Development Journal (IPDJ).

## Why Integrate FoNS with AI?

The FoNS has been at the forefront of person-centred practice development for decades. By combining this rich, evidence-based literature with modern GenAI tools, educators can:

- **Ground AI outputs** in nursing values, not generic internet data.
- **Promote critical thinking** by asking students to compare AI-generated content with peer-reviewed sources.
- **Model best practice** in using AI responsibly within healthcare education.

---

## Curriculum Integration Ideas

### 1. IPDJ as "Grounding Text"

Use articles from the [IPDJ Archive](https://www.fons.org/library/journal/) as primary sources in your teaching. Then, ask students to use AI to:

- **Summarise** the key findings of an article.
- **Critique** the summary by comparing it to their own reading.
- **Apply** the findings to a clinical scenario.

**Example Prompt for Students:**

```text
Summarise the key findings of the following article from the International Practice Development Journal. Then, explain how these findings could be applied to the care of a patient with dementia in an acute hospital setting.

[Paste article abstract or key section here]
```

**Discussion Point:** Where does the AI's summary fall short? What nuances from the original article are lost?

---

### 2. AI-Facilitated Reflective Writing

Use AI to scaffold **Gibbs' Reflective Cycle** or **Driscoll's Model of Reflection**.

**Example Prompt for Educators:**

```text
You are a facilitator for reflective writing. A nursing student will describe a clinical experience. Your role is to guide them through Gibbs' Reflective Cycle by asking questions for each stage: Description, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, and Action Plan. Do not complete the reflection for them; only ask guiding questions.
```

**Teaching Tip:** Have students submit both their AI-guided reflection and a short meta-reflection on what it was like to use AI for this purpose.

---

### 3. Creating Diverse Case Studies

One challenge in nursing education is creating case studies that reflect the diversity of patient populations. AI can assist, but must be prompted carefully.

**Example Prompt:**

```text
Generate a clinical case study for a 55-year-old Somali woman with gestational diabetes. The case study should:
- Include culturally specific considerations (e.g., fasting during Ramadan).
- Avoid stereotypes.
- Highlight person-centred outcomes using the McCormack & McCance framework.
- Include 3 discussion questions for students.
```

**Important:** Always review AI-generated case studies for accuracy and cultural sensitivity. Use them as drafts, not finished products.

---

### 4. Assessing Empathy Through AI

While AI cannot truly assess empathy, it can help students *practise* and *articulate* empathetic responses.

**Classroom Activity:**

1.  Present a short video clip of a patient expressing a concern.
2.  Ask students to write a response.
3.  Have students use AI to get feedback on their response using a prompt like:

    ```text
    I am a nursing student. Please provide feedback on the following response I gave to a patient who was upset about a delayed discharge. Was my response empathetic? Did I use jargon? How could I improve?

    "I understand you're frustrated. We're doing everything we can."
    ```

4.  Discuss as a class: Was the AI's feedback helpful? What did it miss?

## Embedding FoNS Principles in AI Prompts

The CARE prompt framework can be adapted to embed FoNS values:

| Element | Description | Example (FoNS-Aligned) |
|---|---|---|
| **C**ontext | Background information | "You are grounded in the FoNS Person-Centred Nursing Framework." |
| **A**ction | What the AI should do | "Analyse this care plan for person-centred language." |
| **R**ole | The persona for the AI | "Act as a practice development facilitator." |
| **E**xpectation | Desired output format | "Provide feedback in bullet points, referencing the framework." |

## Caution: AI Limitations in Person-Centred Care

:::warning Important
AI can simulate person-centred language, but it does not *understand* person-centredness. Always remind students:
- AI outputs are a starting point, not a final answer.
- Empathy is a human quality that cannot be replaced by technology.
- Critical appraisal of any AI output is essential.
