## Critical Learning Points

1.  **Automation Bias**: Just because the AI output looks professional (perfect grammar, formatting) doesn't mean it's clinically accurate.
2.  **Privacy**: Never trade patient confidentiality for speed.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI cannot see, smell, or touch the patient. Only you can do that.
