# Nursing Case Studies

:::info Attribution
**Nursing case studies created specifically for UK nursing education**  
**Author**: Lincoln Gombedza, RN (LD)  
**Inspired by**: Original case studies from "Educators' guide to multimodal learning and Generative AI" by Tünde Varga-Atkins, Samuel Saunders, et al. (2024/25)  
**Last Updated**: December 2025
:::

These case studies demonstrate practical applications of multimodal GenAI in UK nursing education. Each case study includes:

- **Context** — The educational or clinical setting
- **Challenge** — The problem being addressed
- **Solution** — How GenAI was used multimodally
- **Tools Used** — Specific GenAI platforms and technologies
- **Outcomes** — Results and impact on learning
- **Key Learnings** — Lessons for other educators
- **NMC Alignment** — How this supports NMC standards
