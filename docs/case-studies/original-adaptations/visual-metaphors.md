## Concept
Asking students to generate an image that represents a concept can reveal their depth of understanding.

## The Task
"Generate an image that represents **'Holistic Care'**."

*   **Student A** generates an image of a nurse holding a hand. (Focus: Empathy).
*   **Student B** generates an image of a puzzle being put together. (Focus: Multidisciplinary Team).
*   **Student C** generates an image of a tree with deep roots. (Focus: Social determinants of health).

## Example Student Output: "The Roots of Health"
![Holistic Care Tree](../../../static/img/holistic_tree.png)
*A student-generated image representing how "unseen" roots (social factors) support the visible tree (patient health).*

## Discussion
The class discusses *why* they chose those metaphors. The prompt engineering reflects their conceptual framework.
