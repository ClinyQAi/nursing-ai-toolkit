One of the most powerful applications of Generative AI in nursing is the ability to create "infinite" simulated patients. This allows students to practice history taking and decision-making in a low-stakes environment.

## The "Persona" Method
To make a simulation effective, you must give the AI a rich "backstory" or persona. Instead of just saying "Act as a patient", you give it a name, age, medical history, and emotional state.

## Safety & Ethics
*   **No Real Data**: Never imput real patient details to create a "digital twin" on a public model.
*   **The "Stop" Word**: If a simulation becomes distressed or inappropriate, teach students they can type "STOP SIMULATION" to reset the AI.
