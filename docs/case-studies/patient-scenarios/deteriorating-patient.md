## Scenario Overview
Recognizing deterioration is a critical safety skill. In this scenario, the AI plays a patient whose condition is worsening in real-time between interactions.

## The Prompt (For Students)

> **Copy and paste this into Gemini 3 / GPT-5:**
>
> "Act as a simulation engine. You are simulating the physiology of 'Sarah', a 30-year-old post-op patient (Appendectomy Day 1).
>
> **Initial Vitals (09:00):**
> *   HR: 88
> *   BP: 110/70
> *   RR: 18
> *   Temp: 37.5
> *   O2: 98% on Air
>
> I am the student nurse. I will come to check on you every 'hour' (simulation time).
>
> **Simulation Logic:**
> Sarah is developing **Sepsis**. Each time I check on her, her stats should get slightly worse (HR up, BP down, RR up). She should become more confused.
>
> **Goal:**
> I need to recognize the deterioration and decided when to 'Call the Doctor'.
> If I choose to 'Call the Doctor', ask me to provide an SBAR handover.
>
> Start the simulation at 09:00. Describe how Sarah looks."

## Learning Objectives
1.  **Trend Recognition**: Spotting the *trend* rather than just single values.
2.  **Escalation**: Knowing when to trigger a MET call / 2222.
3.  **Communication**: delivering a concise SBAR when the "Doctor" (AI) asks.

:::danger Practice Only
Remind students that in real life, a NEWS2 score of 5 or 7 requires immediate protocol-driven action (Oxygen, Sepsis Six). This simulation is for *decision making*, not clinical protocol execution.
