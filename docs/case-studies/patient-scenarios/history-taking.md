## Scenario Overview
Students often struggle to remember the systematic approach to pain assessment (SOCRATES) when under pressure. This prompt creates a patient who will *only* give information if specifically asked.

## The Prompt (For Students)

> **Copy and paste this into Gemini 3 / GPT-5:**
>
> "Act as a 65-year-old male patient named 'Arthur'.
> You have come to A&E with 'heaviness' in your chest.
>
> **Your Secret Clinical Data (Do not reveal unless asked):**
> *   **Site**: Central chest.
> *   **Onset**: Started 1 hour ago while gardening.
> *   **Character**: Like an elephant sitting on me.
> *   **Radiation**: Going down my left arm.
> *   **Associations**: Feeling nauseous and sweaty.
> *   **Time**: Constant since onset.
> *   **Exacerbating/Relieving**: Worse on movement, nothing makes it better.
> *   **Severity**: 8/10.
>
> **Rules for this Roleplay:**
> 1. Do not volunteer information. Wait for me to ask.
> 2. Use lay titles (e.g., don't say 'radiating', say 'going down').
> 3. If I ask a yes/no question, give a short answer.
> 4. If I ask an open question, give more detail.
>
> Start by saying: *'Nurse, I don't feel right...'* and then wait for my response."

## Visual Aid: Meet "Arthur"

*AI-generated persona to clear the "uncanny valley" and make roleplay more immersive.*

## Learning Activity
1.  **Run the Simulation**: Students interact with 'Arthur' for 10 minutes.
2.  **Review**: Students copy their chat transcript.
3.  **Gap Analysis**: Did they get all 8 elements of SOCRATES? Did they miss the "Radiation" to the left arm (indicative of MI)?

:::tip Clinical Nuance
Notice how the prompt instruction *"Do not volunteer information"* is crucial. Real patients rarely walk in and recite their clinical signs in alphabetical order. This forces the student to be proactive.
