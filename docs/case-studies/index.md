Explore how Generative AI is being applied across various nursing education contexts. These case studies provide practical insights, student feedback, and direct alignment with NMC standards.

## Case Study Categories

We have organized our examples into several key domains of nursing practice:

### 🩺 [Patient Scenarios](./patient-scenarios)
Practice history taking, NEWS2 assessment, and clinical reasoning with virtual patients.

### 💉 [Clinical Skills](./clinical-skills)
Using AI to visualize complex anatomy (Wound Care) and conceptual metaphors (ECG Interpretation).

### 🗣️ [Communication & Empathy](./person-centred-care)
Refining person-centred language and practicing difficult conversations in a safe environment.

### 🎨 [Original Student Adaptations](./original-adaptations)
Seeing how students take ownership of AI tools to create their own visual metaphors and study aids.

## Why Case Studies?

Case studies bridge the gap between AI theory and clinical reality. They help educators:
1. **Reduce Anxiety**: See how others have successfully (and safely) used AI.
2. **Standardize Practice**: Align AI use with institutional and professional standards.
3. **Inspire Students**: Show them how to use AI for professional development, not just task completion.
