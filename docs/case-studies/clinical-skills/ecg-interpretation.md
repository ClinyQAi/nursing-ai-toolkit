## The Challenge
Students often struggle to link the squiggly lines on an ECG to the mechanical action of the heart.

## The Prompt (For Education)

> **Copy and paste this into Gemini 3 / GPT-5:**
>
> "Explain the **P-QRS-T complex** of a normal sinus rhythm to a first-year student.
>
> **The Visual Metaphor:**
> Use the analogy of a 'Message Runner' visiting different parts of a castle (The Heart).
> *   **SA Node**: The King giving the order.
> *   **AV Node**: The Gatekeeper pausing the message.
> *   **Bundle of His**: The Fast Highway.
>
> **The Diagram:**
> Create a Mermaid sequence diagram showing the electrical flow vs. time."

## Visual Aid: The "Heart Castle" Analogy

*Using metaphor (Kings, Gates, Highways) helps students visualize the invisible electrical pathway.*

## Learning Outcome
By linking the abstract concept (electricity) to a concrete story (the castle), retrieval practice becomes easier.

:::danger Safety Check
A student might ask: *"I have an ECG here that looks like [description], what is it?"*
**Teach them why this is dangerous.** The AI cannot see the 'whole clinical picture' and will often hallucinate a diagnosis based on text descriptions.
