Clinical skills often involve complex physiological mechanisms that are hard to visualize from text alone. Generative AI can act as a **Hyper-Personalized Tutor**, creating analogies, diagrams, and explanations on demand.

:::danger CLINICAL SAFETY WARNING
**AI IS NOT A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL.**
Never use AI to interpret real patient data (ECGs, X-Rays) in a clinical setting.
These case studies are for **educational theory** only.

## In This Section

### [ECG Interpretation](./ecg-interpretation.md)
Using AI to explain the *theory* of ECG waveforms (P-waves, QRS complexes) using visual metaphors.

### [Medication Mechanisms](./medication-mechanism.md)
Using AI to visualize pharmacodynamics (e.g., "How do ACE Inhibitors actually work?").
