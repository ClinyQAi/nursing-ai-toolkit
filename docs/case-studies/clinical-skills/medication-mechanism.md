## The Challenge
Pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) is often dense and dry.

## The Prompt (For Students)

> **Copy and paste this into Gemini 3 / GPT-5:**
>
> "I am struggling to understand how **Beta Blockers (e.g., Bisoprolol)** reduce blood pressure.
>
> 1.  **The Analogy**: Explain it using the analogy of a 'Key' (Adrenaline) and a 'Lock' (Beta Receptor) on a door (The Heart).
> 2.  **The Visual**: Describe an image I could generate with DALL-E that represents this 'blocked lock' mechanism.
> 3.  **The Side Effect**: Explain why this mechanism causes cold hands/feet."

## Why this works
It forces the student to engage with the *mechanism* (locks and keys) rather than just memorizing the list of side effects.
