When using GenAI in nursing education, there are significant personal costs and responsibilities that both educators and students must consider.

## Personal Accountability

<div className="mdx-grid-2">
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <span className="mdx-icon">🎓</span>
    <h3>For Students</h3>
    
    <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Students must understand that using AI without proper attribution constitutes academic misconduct</li>
      <li>The NMC Code emphasizes honesty and integrity - this extends to academic work</li>
      <li>Using AI to complete assessments without disclosure undermines professional development</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Clinical Competence</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Over-reliance on AI for clinical reasoning can weaken critical thinking skills</li>
      <li>Students must develop independent clinical judgment for patient safety</li>
      <li>AI should supplement, not replace, clinical learning experiences</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Professional Identity</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Nursing requires empathy, compassion, and human connection</li>
      <li>Excessive AI use may diminish development of these essential qualities</li>
      <li>Students need authentic experiences to develop professional values</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-card">

    <h3>For Educators</h3>
    
    <h4>Pedagogical Responsibility</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Educators must model responsible AI use</li>
      <li>Clear guidance needed on when and how AI should be used</li>
      <li>Responsibility to teach AI literacy alongside clinical skills</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Assessment Design</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Need to create AI-resilient assessments that measure authentic competence</li>
      <li>Responsibility to ensure assessments align with NMC standards</li>
      <li>Must balance innovation with academic rigor</li>
    </ul>

## Privacy and Data Protection

:::warning Patient Confidentiality
**Never input patient-identifiable information into AI tools.** Anonymize all case studies and adhere strictly to GDPR and institutional policies.
:::

<div className="mdx-grid-2">
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <h4>🔒 Personal Information</h4>
    <p>Be cautious with personal student data. Comply with GDPR and university data protection policies. Anonymize all clinical scenarios by removing identifying details (names, dates, locations).</p>
  </div>
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <h4>👣 Digital Footprint</h4>
    <p>Everything shared with AI tools may be stored and used for training. Consider long-term implications of AI interactions and maintain professional standards in all communications.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Cognitive Costs

<div className="mdx-grid-2">
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <span className="mdx-icon">🧠</span>
    <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
    <h4>Skill Atrophy</h4>
    <p>Over-reliance on AI can weaken problem-solving abilities and clinical reasoning confidence.</p>
    <h4>Learning Depth</h4>
    <p>AI-generated summaries may reduce deep engagement, leading to surface-level learning that doesn't support expertise.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <span className="mdx-icon">💭</span>
    <h3>Metacognition</h3>
    <h4>Self-Awareness</h4>
    <p>Students must recognize when they rely too heavily on AI and understand their own learning processes, strengths, and areas for growth.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Time, Effort & Finance

<div className="mdx-grid-2">
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <span className="mdx-icon">⏳</span>
    <h3>The Efficiency Paradox</h3>
    <p><strong>Short-term vs. Long-term:</strong> AI may save time initially but can create dependency. Quick answers don't build lasting knowledge.</p>
    <p><strong>Skill Investment:</strong> Learning to use AI effectively (prompt engineering) requires significant time and practice.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-card">
    <span className="mdx-icon">💳</span>
    <h3>Financial Costs</h3>
    <p><strong>Premium Tools:</strong> Advanced features often require subscriptions, creating equity issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Hidden Costs:</strong> Data usage, potential hardware upgrades, and professional training expenses.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Emotional Considerations

:::tip Addressing Anxiety
Students and educators may face anxiety about AI use, fear of plagiarism accusations, or "imposter syndrome" regarding AI-assisted work. **Open dialogue and clear guidelines are key to mitigation.**

## Mitigation Strategies

<div className="mdx-grid-2">
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <h3>For Students</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Set Boundaries:</strong> Use AI as a supplement, not a replacement. Maintain regular practice without AI.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Transparency:</strong> Always disclose AI use and keep records of your process.</li>
      <li><strong>Develop Self-Awareness:</strong> Regularly assess your understanding without AI.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-card">
    <h3>For Educators</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Provide Clear Guidelines:</strong> specific policies on acceptable AI use.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Responsible Use:</strong> Demonstrate ethical AI integration.</li>
      <li><strong>Support Student Development:</strong> Teach AI literacy and critical evaluation.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

## Reflection Questions

<div className="mdx-card" style={{borderLeft: '4px solid var(--ifm-color-primary)'}}>
  <h3>🤔 Evaluate Your AI Use</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Can you explain and justify every instance of AI use in your work?</li>
    <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Is AI enhancing or replacing your learning process?</li>
    <li><strong>Competence:</strong> Are you developing the clinical skills needed for safe practice?</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Would you be comfortable disclosing your AI use to patients, mentors, or examiners?</li>
    <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Are you maintaining skills that don't rely on AI?</li>
  </ul>
