# Responsible Use of AI in Multimodal Context

Despite the way GenAI is often marketed as efficient, trustworthy, innovative and invaluable to boosting users' productivity, integrating GenAI into multimodal learning brings substantial pedagogical, social and ethical challenges.

## The Reality Check

The responsible use of multimodal GenAI in nursing education requires a careful balance of:

- **Ethical considerations**
- **Pedagogical effectiveness** 
- **Legal compliance**
- **Practical sustainability**

### Key Concerns:

1. **Accuracy** — AI's outputs can contain errors or hallucinations
2. **Bias** — Reflects entrenched social biases in training data
3. **Over-reliance** — May weaken student voice or critical thinking
4. **Uncertainty** — Educators and students feel unsure about effective, ethical use
5. **Policy ambiguity** — Institutional policies may be vague or unclear

:::warning For Nursing Education
These concerns are amplified in nursing where accuracy and patient safety are paramount. A hallucinated medication dose or incorrect clinical procedure could have serious consequences if students don't verify information against authoritative sources.

## Four Key Cost Areas

Beckingham and Hartley (2025a) suggest four areas to consider when looking at the cost of using GenAI:

### 1. Cost to the Individual
* **Accountability**: Students must take responsibility for AI-generated work. Academic integrity and professional honesty are paramount.
* **Privacy**: Sharing patient or personal data with AI models poses significant risks. Identifying details must never be uploaded.
* **Cognitive Load**: Over-reliance can lead to "skill atrophy" where critical thinking and basic competencies weaken over time.
* **Emotional Impact**: Anxiety about "keeping up" and imposter syndrome ("did I write this or did the AI?") are growing concerns.

### 2. Cost to the Environment
* **Energy Consumption**: Generative AI models consume vast amounts of electricity for both training and daily queries (far more than standard web searches).
* **Carbon Footprint**: Data centers contribute significantly to global emissions. Nursing's commitment to public health includes environmental stewardship.
* **E-Waste**: The demand for powerful hardware accelerates device obsolescence, adding to the toxic e-waste stream.

### 3. Cost to Knowledge
* **The "Google Effect"**: We tend to remember *where* to find information rather than the information itself. In clinical practice, immediate internal knowledge is often required.
* **Learning Paradox**: Efficiency isn't always effective. The "struggle" of learning builds neural pathways; AI shortcuts can bypass this essential cognitive effort.
* **Epistemic Trust**: A shift from trusting peer-reviewed research to trusting opaque algorithmic outputs can erode evidence-based practice.

### 4. Cost to Future Jobs
* **Displacement vs. Transformation**: While nursing involves irreplaceable human connection, administrative and diagnostic tasks will shift.
* **New Competencies**: "AI Literacy" is becoming a core skill alongside clinical competence.
* **Human Premium**: Skills that AI cannot replicate—empathy, complex ethical judgment, and physical care—will become even more valuable.
