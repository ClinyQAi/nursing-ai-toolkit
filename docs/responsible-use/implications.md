Understanding the costs of AI is important, but what does this mean in practice for nursing education? This page translates theory into actionable guidance for educators and students.

## For Nursing Educators

### Course Design

**AI-Aware Curriculum**
- Explicitly address AI use in course outlines
- Define acceptable and unacceptable AI applications
- Include AI literacy as a learning outcome
- Balance AI-enhanced and AI-free activities

**Assessment Strategy**
- Design assessments that measure authentic understanding
- Include components that can't be completed with AI alone
- Use varied assessment methods (oral, practical, written)
- Focus on process as well as product

**Example Module Structure**
```
Week 1-2: Introduction to AI in Healthcare
- What is AI and how does it work?
- Ethical considerations
- Hands-on AI tool exploration

Week 3-4: Critical Evaluation
- Assessing AI outputs for accuracy
- Identifying bias and limitations
- Comparing AI to evidence-based sources

Week 5-6: Practical Application
- Using AI for care planning (with oversight)
- AI-assisted patient education materials
- Reflective practice on AI use

Week 7-8: AI-Free Assessment
- Clinical simulation without AI
- Oral examination on clinical reasoning
- Practical skills demonstration
```

### Classroom Practices

**Transparent Modeling**
- Demonstrate your own AI use openly
- Show both successes and failures
- Discuss your decision-making process
- Acknowledge uncertainties

**Structured AI Activities**
- Guided AI exploration with clear objectives
- Comparative exercises (AI vs. traditional methods)
- Critical analysis of AI outputs
- Reflection on learning process

**Discussion Prompts**
- "How did using AI change your understanding?"
- "What would you have done differently without AI?"
- "How confident are you in this AI-generated information?"
- "What are the risks of using this in clinical practice?"

### Policy Development

**Institutional Guidelines**
- Clear statement on acceptable AI use
- Discipline-specific examples
- Consequences for misuse
- Regular policy reviews

**Example Policy Elements**
```markdown
## AI Use in Nursing Assessments

### Permitted:
- Using AI to generate initial ideas for care plans
- AI-assisted literature searches (with verification)
- Creating visual aids for patient education
- Practicing communication scenarios

### Requires Disclosure:
- Any AI use in submitted work
- Specific tools and prompts used
- How AI output was modified

### Prohibited:
- Submitting AI-generated work as your own
- Using AI for closed-book examinations
- Inputting patient-identifiable information
- Bypassing required learning processes
```

## For Students

### Daily Practice

**Before Using AI**
1. **Try it yourself first**
   - Attempt the task independently
   - Identify specific areas where you're stuck
   - Use AI for targeted help, not complete solutions

2. **Define your purpose**
   - What do you want to learn?
   - How will AI help you learn it?
   - What will you do with AI output?

**While Using AI**
1. **Stay critical**
   - Question every AI response
   - Verify against authoritative sources
   - Look for bias or errors
   - Consider alternative perspectives

2. **Document your process**
   - Save prompts and responses
   - Note how you modified AI output
   - Record your learning journey
   - Prepare to explain your work

**After Using AI**
1. **Reflect on learning**
   - What did you actually learn?
   - Could you do this without AI now?
   - What gaps remain in your understanding?
   - How will you address those gaps?

2. **Practice independently**
   - Test yourself without AI
   - Explain concepts to peers
   - Apply knowledge in new contexts
   - Build confidence in your abilities

### Study Strategies

**Balanced Approach**
- Use AI for 20% of study time maximum
- Prioritize active learning methods
- Regular self-testing without AI
- Peer study groups for discussion

**AI as Study Partner**
- Generate practice questions
- Create flashcards (then verify)
- Explain concepts in different ways
- Provide feedback on your explanations

**Traditional Methods Still Essential**
- Handwritten notes for retention
- Reading primary sources
- Clinical practice and simulation
- Face-to-face mentoring

## For Programme Leaders

### Strategic Planning

**Curriculum Review**
- Audit current AI integration
- Identify gaps in AI literacy
- Plan phased implementation
- Align with NMC standards

### Quality Assurance

**Monitoring and Evaluation**
- Track AI use patterns
- Assess impact on learning outcomes
- Gather student and staff feedback
- Adjust policies based on evidence

**External Examiner Guidance**
- Brief examiners on AI policies
- Provide examples of acceptable use
- Clarify assessment criteria
- Ensure consistency across cohorts

## For Clinical Practice Educators

### Placement Learning

**Mentor Guidance**
- Understand student AI policies
- Discuss appropriate AI use in practice
- Model professional technology use
- Support critical evaluation skills
