# 📜 AI Policy Builder

Confusion leads to fear. Use this tool to generate a clear, unambiguous statement for your students about what is (and isn't) allowed in your module.

import PolicyBuilder from '@site/src/components/PolicyBuilder';

<PolicyBuilder />

## Why use this?
*   **Clarity**: Students often don't know the difference between "Grammarly" (AI) and "ChatGPT" (AI).
*   **Standardisation**: Consistent messaging reduces anxiety.
*   **Safety**: Explicitly banning patient data input protects your license.
