The rise of AI raises important questions about the future of work. While nursing is considered relatively AI-resistant due to its human-centered nature, understanding these implications is crucial for preparing students for their careers.

## The Employment Landscape

<div className="mdx-grid-2">
  <div className="mdx-card">
    <span className="mdx-icon">🤖</span>
    <h3>General Workforce</h3>
    <p><strong>Automation:</strong> Routine, repetitive tasks are most vulnerable. Roles requiring creativity and complex judgment are more secure.</p>
    <p><strong>Transformation:</strong> Most jobs won't be replaced, but <em>transformed</em>. Hybrid roles combining human and AI capabilities are emerging.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="mdx-card">
    <span className="mdx-icon">🏥</span>
    <h3>Nursing's Unique Position</h3>
    <p><strong>Human-Centric:</strong> Empathy, physical touch, and holistic assessment cannot be automated.</p>
    <p><strong>High Demand:</strong> With an aging population and chronic disease prevalence, the demand for human nurses continues to outstrip supply.</p>
