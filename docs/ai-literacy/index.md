In the previous section, we emphasised the importance of the critical and responsible use of GenAI in education. This is tied to developing **AI literacy**, enabling educators and learners to effectively and critically engage with GenAI in a multimodal learning context.

## Why AI Literacy Matters in Nursing

:::tip Critical Importance
Developing AI literac(ies) is of critical importance whether you're engaging or disengaging from the technology. If one does not understand the platforms, their functions, contexts, impacts and perceptions, one cannot justifiably use it, or justifiably reject it.
:::

**For nursing specifically**:
- 🏥 **Clinical Reality**: Nurses are increasingly encountering AI in patient monitoring and diagnostics.
- 🛡️ **Safety**: Future nurses must understand how to work alongside AI safely and effectively.
- 📜 **Regulation**: NMC standards require competence in digital technologies.
- ⚖️ **Accountability**: Professional accountability demands understanding the tools we use.

## 📐 Three Levels of AI Literacy

We visualize AI literacy as a progressive journey. You don't need to be an expert immediately; start at the base and build up.

```

### 🟢 Basic Literacy
**Awareness** of multimodal GenAI platforms, their capabilities, and appropriate uses in educational context.

:::note 🩺 Nursing Activities
- Creating prompts for patient scenario generation
- Generating visual care pathway diagrams
- Understanding when GenAI is appropriate vs. inappropriate (e.g., **NOT** for calculating drug doses)
:::

### 🟡 Intermediate Literacy
**Ability** to co-create multimodal content, critically evaluate multimodal AI outputs, and scaffold uses.

:::note 🩺 Nursing Activities
- Transforming lecture notes on wound care into visuals or podcasts
- Critically evaluating AI-generated patient scenarios for accuracy
- Identifying biases in AI-generated health information

:::info 🧩 LD Nursing Spotlight: Easy Read Co-creation
**Activity**: Use AI to draft an "Easy Read" guide for a gastrostomy procedure.
**Skill**: Critically evaluate the AI's language—is it truly accessible? Does it follow [Photosymbols](https://www.photosymbols.com/) principles?
:::
:::

### 🔴 Advanced Literacy
**Designing** activities or assessments that incorporate multimodal uses of GenAI, fostering critical analysis and engagement, and leading ethical and philosophical discussions.

:::note 🩺 Nursing Activities
- Creating assessment rubrics that incorporate appropriate AI use
- Leading discussions on AI ethics in healthcare
- Designing clinical simulations that integrate AI tools appropriately

## 🎓 Key Teaching Competencies

To teach effectively with AI, focus on these three core skills:

## Next Steps for Nursing Educators

1.  **Assess current literacy** — Where are you? Where are your students?
2.  **Start small** — Pick one module to experiment with AI literacy activities
3.  **Build competencies** — Use the frameworks above to structure development
4.  **Share practice** — Join communities like FONS, RCN digital groups, or nursing education networks
5.  **Align with standards** — Map to NMC competencies and HEE frameworks

:::tip Get Started Now
Begin with a simple activity: ask students to generate a patient scenario using AI, then critique it for **clinical accuracy** and **person-centredness**.
