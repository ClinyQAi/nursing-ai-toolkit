### Intermediate Level: Critical Evaluation

**Analytical Competencies**
- [ ] Evaluate AI outputs for accuracy
- [ ] Identify bias in AI responses
- [ ] Assess clinical relevance and safety
- [ ] Compare AI information with evidence-based sources
- [ ] Recognize when to seek human expertise

**Nursing Application**
- Verify AI-generated clinical information against NICE guidelines
- Identify potential bias in patient care recommendations
- Assess whether AI suggestions align with NMC standards
- Determine when AI advice requires clinical validation

### Advanced Level: Ethical Integration

**Professional Competencies**
- [ ] Apply ethical frameworks to AI use
- [ ] Maintain patient confidentiality with AI tools
- [ ] Practice academic and professional integrity

- Craft clear, specific prompts
- Interpret AI outputs correctly
- Troubleshoot common issues
- Manage AI tool settings

**Nursing-Specific Skills**
- Use AI for care plan development
- Generate patient education materials
- Create clinical scenario simulations
- Develop study resources
- Assist with literature reviews

**Self-Assessment Questions**
1. Can you use at least two different AI tools effectively?
2. Do you understand how to improve prompts for better results?
3. Can you identify when AI output is incorrect or biased?
4. Do you know how to verify AI information?
5. Can you explain AI limitations to patients or colleagues?

### 2. Information Literacy

- Am I using AI as a crutch or a tool?
- Can I explain my reasoning without AI?
- Would I be confident defending this decision?
- Does this align with my clinical judgment?

### 4. Ethical Awareness
