Integrating AI literacy into individual modules ensures students develop competencies progressively and contextually. This page provides practical guidance for module leaders.

## Module Design Principles

### 1. Alignment with Learning Outcomes

**Explicit AI Literacy Outcomes**
- Include AI competencies in module learning outcomes
- Align with NMC proficiencies
- Map to programme-level competencies
- Ensure progressive development
- Make expectations clear

**Example Learning Outcomes**
- "Critically evaluate AI-generated clinical information against evidence-based sources"
- "Use AI tools ethically and safely in care planning while maintaining professional accountability"
- "Demonstrate understanding of AI limitations in nursing practice"

### 2. Contextual Integration

**Embed in Clinical Context**
- Relate AI use to module content
- Use nursing-specific examples
- Connect to practice scenarios
- Align with placement learning
- Ensure clinical relevance

**Avoid**
- Generic AI training disconnected from nursing
- Technology for technology's sake
- Unrealistic or impractical applications
- Ignoring clinical context

## Module Planning Framework

### Step 1: Needs Analysis

**Assess Current State**
- What AI tools do students already use?
- What misconceptions exist?
- What competencies are needed?
- What resources are available?
- What are the risks?

**Define Module-Specific Needs**
- Which AI competencies align with this module?
- How can AI enhance learning?
- What are the ethical considerations?
- What support do students need?
- How will competency be assessed?

### Step 2: Learning Design

**Select Appropriate AI Applications**
- Care planning assistance
- Patient education material creation
- Clinical scenario generation
- Literature review support
- Concept explanation

**Design Learning Activities**
- Guided AI exploration
- Critical evaluation exercises
- Comparative analysis (AI vs. traditional)
- Ethical case discussions
- Reflective practice

**Example Activity Sequence**
1. **Week 1**: Introduction to AI in [module topic]
2. **Week 2**: Guided practice with AI tool
3. **Week 3**: Critical evaluation exercise
4. **Week 4**: AI-enhanced assignment
5. **Week 5**: Reflection and peer discussion

### Step 3: Assessment Design

**AI-Aware Assessment**
- Clarify AI use policy for each assessment
- Design tasks that require human insight
- Include process as well as product
- Require justification and reflection
- Use varied assessment methods

**Assessment Types**
- **AI-Enhanced**: Students may use AI with disclosure
- **AI-Assisted**: AI allowed for specific components only
- **AI-Free**: No AI use permitted
- **AI-Focused**: Evaluating AI literacy itself
