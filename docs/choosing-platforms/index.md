Selecting the right AI platform is a critical decision for nursing educators. The landscape is rapidly evolving, with a wide range of general-purpose and specialized tools available. This section provides a framework for evaluating and choosing platforms that align with pedagogical goals, professional standards, and institutional requirements.

## The AI Tool Landscape

AI tools in nursing education can generally be categorized into three types:

1.  **General-Purpose LLMs**: Versatile models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini that can handle a wide array of tasks.
2.  **Specialized Healthcare AI**: Tools specifically trained or fine-tuned on clinical data and medical literature.
3.  **Educational Integration Tools**: Platforms that integrate AI into existing educational workflows, such as VLE plugins or automated feedback systems.

## Key Considerations for Nursing

When choosing a platform, nursing educators must prioritize:

-   **Clinical Accuracy**: Does the model produce reliable medical information?
-   **Ethical Safety**: Does it protect patient and student data?
-   **NMC Alignment**: Does it support the development of required nursing proficiencies?
-   **Accessibility**: Is it usable for all students, regardless of technical skill or financial means?
