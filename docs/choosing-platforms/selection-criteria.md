When evaluating an AI tool for use in a nursing module or programme, it's helpful to categorize your requirements into four main areas: **Pedagogical**, **Technical**, **Ethical/Legal**, and **Sustainable**.

## 1. Pedagogical Criteria

The primary question is: **Does the tool enhance learning in a way that aligns with nursing competencies?**

-   **Accuracy of Medical Knowledge**: Does the tool provide accurate nursing theory, pathophysiology, and clinical guidance?
-   **Nuance and Tone**: Can the tool adopt a professional, empathetic nursing tone appropriate for patient interaction simulations?
-   **Reasoning Capability**: Can it handle complex "What if?" patient scenarios requiring clinical judgment?
-   **Output Variety**: Does it support the multimodal needs of the module (text, images, audio)?

## 2. Technical Criteria

The tool must be usable and stable within the existing institutional infrastructure.

-   **Ease of Access**: Is there a web interface? Mobile app? Single Sign-On (SSO) integration?
-   **API Availability**: Can the tool be integrated into other nursing education software (e.g., VLEs)?
-   **Stability and Performance**: Is the tool reliable during peak usage hours (e.g., during an exam or workshop)?
-   **Customization**: Can we provide "system instructions" or "custom instructions" to keep the AI focused on UK nursing standards (NMC)?

## 3. Ethical and Legal Criteria

Nursing education is bound by strict ethical and professional standards (NMC Code).

-   **Data Security & Privacy**: Where is the data stored? Is it used for training the model? Is it GDPR compliant?
-   **Bias and Fairness**: How does the tool handle diverse patient scenarios (different ethnicities, genders, socio-economic backgrounds)?
-   **Transparency**: Is it clear when the output is AI-generated? Does the tool cite its sources?
-   **Intellectual Property**: Who owns the outputs created by students and staff?

## 4. Sustainability Criteria

The long-term viability of the tool must be considered.

-   **Financial Sustainability**: Is the pricing model predictable? Are there free tiers or academic discounts?
-   **Environmental Impact**: Does the provider have a commitment to net-zero carbon operations?
-   **Scalability**: Can the tool support a whole cohort of 200+ nursing students simultaneously?

### Evaluation Checklist for Educators

Before introducing a new AI tool to students, run through this quick checklist:

1.  **[ ] Accuracy:** Have I tested it on a known complex clinical topic?
2.  **[ ] Security:** Have I confirmed it meets university data privacy requirements?
3.  **[ ] Accessibility:** Can students with disabilities or those without expensive hardware use it?
4.  **[ ] Professionalism:** Does its output align with the NMC Code of Conduct?
