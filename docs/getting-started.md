# Getting Started

Welcome to the **AI Educator Toolkit**, a practical guide for integrating Generative AI into UK nursing education. This toolkit is designed to help educators, students, and institutional leaders navigate the rapidly evolving AI landscape safely and effectively.

## 🚀 Recommended Pathways

Depending on your role, we recommend starting with the following sections:

### For Nursing Educators
1.  **[Design Framework](/docs/design-framework/)**: A step-by-step guide to integrating AI into your curriculum.
2.  **[Teaching with AI](/docs/teaching/)**: Practical examples of using AI for lesson plan generation, visuals, and simulations.
3.  **[Responsible Use Checklist](/docs/responsible-use/checklist)**: Actionable steps to ensure ethical AI use in your classroom.

### For Nursing Students
1.  **[What is Generative AI?](/docs/what-is-generative-ai)**: A plain-English introduction to the technology.
2.  **[Individual Competencies](/docs/ai-literacy/individual-competencies)**: A checklist of skills you need to develop.
3.  **[Case Studies](/docs/case-studies/)**: Real-world examples of how AI is used in nursing practice.

### For Institutional Leaders
1.  **[Institutional Framework](/docs/ai-literacy/institutional-framework)**: Guidance on university-wide policy and governance.
2.  **[Choosing Platforms](/docs/choosing-platforms/)**: Frameworks for selecting and procuring AI tools at scale.

## 🛠️ Core Principles

Every resource in this toolkit is grounded in three core principles:

1.  **Person-Centred**: AI should enhance, not replace, the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship.
2.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: Clinical decisions must always be made and verified by a human professional.
3.  **Aligned with Standards**: All guidance is mapped to the **NMC Future Nurse (2018)** proficiencies.
