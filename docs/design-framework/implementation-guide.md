A successful rollout depends on clear communication and careful preparation. AI can be intimidating for both staff and students if not managed properly.

## 1. Prepare Your Staff

-   **Technical Briefing**: Ensure all lecturers and clinical instructors know how to log in and use the specific tool.
-   **Pedagogical Alignment**: Explain *why* AI is being used in this module and how it maps to outcomes.
-   **Managing Resistance**: Acknowledge concerns about AI (e.g., cheating or job loss) and re-focus on AI as an "augmented intelligence" tool for better care.

## 2. Onboard Your Students

-   **The "AI Contract"**: Have a clear discussion or document outlining what is acceptable use (e.g., brainstorming) and what is not (e.g., copying verbatim for an essay).
-   **Prompt Tutorials**: Provide a 15-minute "How-to-Prompt" session relevant to the specific module tasks.
-   **Accessibility Check**: Ensure students who may struggle with technology are paired with "digital buddies" or given extra support.

## 3. Pilot Small, Then Scale

-   **The Alpha Test**: Run the activity yourself or with a few colleagues first to find obvious "bugs" or hallucinations.
-   **The Pilot**: Run it with one small seminar group before rolling it out to the entire 300-person cohort.
-   **Real-time Support**: Have a "Teams" channel or physical helpdesk available during the first week of the AI activity.

## 4. Communication is Key

-   **Be Transparent**: Tell students exactly which model you are using (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and why.
-   **Acknowledge Errors**: If the AI makes a mistake during a demo, use it as a "teachable moment" for critical evaluation.

**Next**: Don't forget to close the loop with **[Evaluation & Iteration](./evaluation)**.
