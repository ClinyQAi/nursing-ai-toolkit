Before implementing any AI tool, a thorough needs analysis ensures the technology solves a real problem rather than creating new ones.

## 1. Identify the Target Audience

-   **Who are the learners?** (e.g., Year 1 undergraduates, postgraduate research students, post-registration nurses?)
-   **Digital Literacy Level**: Do they have the basic digital skills to use an AI interface effectively?
-   **Access to Technology**: Do all students have equal access to the necessary hardware and high-speed internet?

## 2. Identify the Educational Gap

Avoid the "hammer looking for a nail" problem. Ask:
-   **Is there a specific clincal scenario that is currently hard to simulate?** (e.g., rare deteriorating patient cases).
-   **Are students struggling with a particular concept?** (e.g., complex pharmacological mechanisms).
-   **Is staff time being consumed by routine tasks?** (e.g., generating 50 slightly different case studies).

## 3. Map to Learning Outcomes (and NMC)

Every AI activity must map back to the curriculum.
-   **NMC Proficiency**: Which specific Future Nurse standard (2018) does this support? (e.g., Communication, Coordination of care, etc.)
-   **Evidence-Based Practice**: Does the activity help students learn how to evaluate research or policy?

## 4. Resource Scan

-   **Staff Capacity**: Do the educators have the time and training to facilitate this AI activity?
-   **Institutional Support**: Is the University's IT and Library team on board?
-   **Cost**: Is there budget for premium AI features if the free version is insufficient?

### Questions for Your Team

-   "What is one thing we currently do poorly that AI could do better?"
-   "What is the biggest risk of introducing AI to this specific cohort?"
-   "How will this change the way we assess student competence?"
