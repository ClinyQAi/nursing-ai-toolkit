Learning design is the process of choosing the right "modality" of AI to match the educational goal identified in the Needs Analysis.

## 1. Choose the AI Modality

Depending on the module, you might choose one or more of these modalities:

-   **AI as a Personal Tutor**: Students use AI to explain complex concepts (e.g., "Explain the RAAS system like I'm a first-year student").
-   **AI as a Clinical Simulator**: Students interact with an AI-driven "patient" to practice history taking or de-escalation skills.
-   **AI as a Feedback Bot**: Students submit a draft care plan or reflection and get instant, formative feedback based on specific rubrics.
-   **AI as a Creative Partner**: Students work with AI to generate patient education visuals or clinical metaphors.

## 2. Structure the Prompting Strategy

Educators should provide students with "Scaffolded Prompts" rather than letting them start with a blank screen. This ensures clinical safety and pedagogical focus.

**Example Structured Prompt for Students**:
> "You are an AI patient named Arther, a 65-year-old with heart failure. I am a student nurse performing a nursing assessment. Only answer from Arthur's perspective. Do not provide medical advice. Wait for me to ask my first question."

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Design

Crucially, some parts of the activity must remain human-centric:
-   **The Briefing**: Educator explains the purpose and the AI's limitations.
-   **The Interaction**: Student engages with the AI tool.
-   **The Debriefing (Critical)**: A group or individual session to discuss what the AI got right, what it got wrong, and how it felt to use it.

## 4. Multimodal Integration

Consider how different types of AI can work together:
-   **Text AI**: To generate a case script.
-   **Image AI**: To generate a photo of the "wound" or the "patient's environment" based on that script.
-   **Voice AI**: To "speak" the patient's lines during a simulated handoff.
