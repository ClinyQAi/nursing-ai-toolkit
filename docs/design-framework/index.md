Successfully integrating Generative AI into a nursing curriculum requires more than just picking a tool; it requires a structured pedagogical approach. This "Design Framework" provides a step-by-step methodology for educators to move from initial idea to a fully integrated, evaluated educational experience.

## The Design Process at a Glance

The framework follows a five-stage iterative process:

1.  **Needs Analysis**: Identifying the target audience, the clinical gap, and the desired learning outcomes.
2.  **Learning Design**: Selecting the appropriate AI modality and structuring the activity or assessment.
3.  **Implementation**: Preparing staff and students for the rollout of the AI-enhanced module.
4.  **Evaluation**: Measuring the impact on learning and student experience.
5.  **Iteration**: Refining the design based on feedback and the latest AI developments.

## Why Use a Framework?

By using a structured framework, nursing educators can:
-   **Ensure NMC Compliance**: Guarantee that AI use supports, rather than distracts from, professional proficiencies.
-   **Prioritize Safety**: Ensure that clinical scenarios are evidence-based and safe for learning.
-   **Increase Efficiency**: Avoid "reinventing the wheel" by following a proven pedagogical path.
-   **Foster Innovation**: Encourage creative yet disciplined experimentation with new multimodal AI features.
