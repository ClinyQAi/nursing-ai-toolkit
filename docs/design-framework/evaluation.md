Integration is an ongoing journey. As AI models improve, your educational activities should evolve.

## 1. What to Measure?

-   **Student Engagement**: Did they actually use the tool? Did they find it helpful? (Simple Likert scale survey).
-   **Learning Outcomes**: Did the AI-enhanced group perform better on the practical assessment than previous cohorts?
-   **Clinical Logic**: In their reflections, did students demonstrate a deeper understanding of the "Why" behind clinical decisions?
-   **Ethical Awareness**: Did students correctly cite the AI and analyze its clinical limitations?

## 2. Methods of Evaluation

-   **Student Surveys**: Post-module surveys focused on AI usability and pedagogical value.
-   **Focus Groups**: Small discussions with students and staff to dive deeper into the "friction points."
-   **Data Analytics**: If the platform allows, analyze anonymized prompt patterns to see where students were getting stuck.
-   **Vivas / Oral Debriefs**: Asking students verbally to explain their AI-assisted work is a high-fidelity way to measure true learning.

## 3. The Iteration Cycle

Based on the evaluation, make changes for the next version of the module:

1.  **Refine the Prompts**: If students got "bad" answers, improve the primer prompts/instructions.
2.  **Adjust the Scaffolding**: If students were overwhelmed, add more guided steps. If they were bored, make the task more open-ended.
3.  **Update the Model**: If a faster or more accurate model becomes available, consider switching.

## 4. Share Your Findings

The nursing education community is learning together.
-   **Post-Module Reports**: Share what worked with your department.
-   **Conferences / Journals**: Consider publishing your findings to help other nursing schools.
-   **Case Study Submission**: Add your experience to this toolkit's [Case Studies](/docs/case-studies/) section!

**Congratulations!** You've completed the Design Framework section. You are now ready to implement responsible, effective AI in your nursing curriculum.
