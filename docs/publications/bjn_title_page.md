ABSTRACT

Background: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly transforming healthcare and education. However, UK nurse educators face significant challenges in integrating these technologies into curricula due to limited guidance, concerns about academic integrity, and uncertainty regarding professional standards.

Aims: This paper introduces a freely accessible, open-source educational resource—the AI Educator Toolkit—designed specifically for UK nursing education. The toolkit aims to equip nurse educators with practical strategies for incorporating multimodal GenAI into teaching, learning, and assessment while maintaining alignment with Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) standards.

Methods: The toolkit was developed through adaptation of existing higher education resources, contextualised for UK nursing with clinical case studies, prompt templates, and person-centred care principles. It draws on multimodal learning theory and professional guidance from the NMC, Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and International Council of Nurses (ICN).

Findings: The toolkit provides structured guidance across AI literacy development, teaching strategies, assessment redesign, and ethical considerations. It positions nurses as 'Citizen Developers' who actively shape technology rather than passively adopting it.

Conclusion: As the NMC prepares to integrate AI into professional standards (2027), nurse educators require practical resources now. This toolkit offers an evidence-informed starting point for embedding GenAI literacy into nursing curricula.
