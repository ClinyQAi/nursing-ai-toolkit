# Empowering Nurse Educators: A Multimodal AI Toolkit for UK Nursing Education

## Abstract

**Background:** Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly transforming healthcare and education. However, UK nurse educators face significant challenges in integrating these technologies into curricula due to limited guidance, concerns about academic integrity, and uncertainty regarding professional standards.

**Aims:** This paper introduces a freely accessible, open-source educational resource—the AI Educator Toolkit—designed specifically for UK nursing education. The toolkit aims to equip nurse educators with practical strategies for incorporating multimodal GenAI into teaching, learning, and assessment while maintaining alignment with Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) standards.

**Methods:** The toolkit was developed through adaptation of existing higher education resources, contextualised for UK nursing with clinical case studies, prompt templates, and person-centred care principles. It draws on multimodal learning theory and professional guidance from the NMC, Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and International Council of Nurses (ICN).

**Findings:** The toolkit provides structured guidance across AI literacy development, teaching strategies, assessment redesign, and ethical considerations. It positions nurses as 'Citizen Developers' who actively shape technology rather than passively adopting it.

**Conclusion:** As the NMC prepares to integrate AI into professional standards (2027), nurse educators require practical resources now. This toolkit offers an evidence-informed starting point for embedding GenAI literacy into nursing curricula.

## Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is no longer a future possibility but a present reality. From diagnostic algorithms to patient monitoring systems, AI technologies are increasingly embedded in clinical practice (Ronquillo et al 2021). Nursing, as the largest healthcare profession globally, must prepare its workforce to engage effectively with these technologies. This preparation begins in education.

Generative AI (GenAI)—systems capable of creating text, images, and other content—has emerged as a particularly transformative technology since the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Student nurses are already using these tools for study, research, and assignment preparation, often without structured guidance (O'Connor and ChatGPT 2023). Educators face a critical choice: prohibit these tools and risk irrelevance, or embrace them thoughtfully and prepare students for AI-augmented practice.

This paper presents the AI Educator Toolkit, a freely available online resource designed to support UK nurse educators in navigating this challenge. The toolkit provides practical guidance for integrating multimodal GenAI into nursing curricula while maintaining professional and ethical standards.

## Background

### The Digital Literacy Imperative

Digital literacy has become a foundational competency in nursing education. The NMC Standards of Proficiency for Registered Nurses (2018) include requirements for nurses to use digital technologies to access, record, and share information (NMC 2018). However, these standards predate the GenAI revolution and offer limited guidance on these emerging technologies.

The NMC has acknowledged this gap. In November 2025, the Council reported that feedback on its Code review called for 'clearer standards on the safe and appropriate use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in nursing and midwifery' (NMC 2025a). The updated Code, expected in 2027, will address AI, but educators cannot wait three years to prepare students for technologies they are using today.

### The Case for Multimodal Learning

Clinical nursing practice is inherently multimodal. Nurses communicate through verbal handovers, written documentation, visual assessments, and physical demonstrations. Patient care involves interpreting multiple information sources simultaneously: vital signs monitors, facial expressions, wound appearances, and verbal reports.

Kress (2009) argues that effective communication requires understanding how different modes—text, image, sound, gesture—work together to create meaning. In nursing education, multimodal approaches can enhance learning by reflecting the multimodal reality of clinical practice. Generative AI now enables the creation of multimodal learning materials at scale, offering opportunities to diversify teaching approaches without proportional increases in educator workload.

### Professional Positions on AI

The International Council of Nurses (ICN) has called for nurses to be 'actively engaged and lead in all phases of AI solution development, implementation, and evaluation' (ICN 2024). The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has emphasised that 'AI has significant potential to modernise services but must enhance, rather than replace, personal nursing care' (RCN 2025).

These positions reflect a consensus that nurses should approach AI neither with uncritical enthusiasm nor reflexive rejection. Vallor (2024) describes this as 'a middle way'—critical engagement that acknowledges both potential benefits and risks. The AI Educator Toolkit operationalises this approach for nursing education contexts.

## The AI Educator Toolkit

### Development and Adaptation

The toolkit builds upon the 'Educators' guide to multimodal learning and Generative AI', a resource developed by Varga-Atkins, Saunders, and colleagues through a SEDA (Staff and Educational Development Association) Small Grants project (Varga-Atkins et al 2024). This foundational work, published under an open Creative Commons licence (CC BY-NC 4.0), was adapted and contextualised for UK nursing education.

Key adaptations include:
- Clinical case studies aligned with NMC fields of practice
- Integration of person-centred care principles from the Foundation of Nursing Studies (FONS)
- Prompt templates for common nursing education scenarios
- Alignment with UK clinical guidelines (NICE, BNF)
- Ethical frameworks specific to healthcare AI

### Core Components

The toolkit is organised into seven interconnected sections:

**1. Responsible Use of AI**
This section addresses sustainability, cost considerations, and institutional policies. It emphasises that AI use must be transparent, documented, and proportionate to educational benefit.

**2. AI Literacy Framework**
Drawing on competency frameworks from Ng et al (2021), the toolkit presents AI literacy as developing across four levels: personal use, classroom integration, programme-level embedding, and institutional leadership. Nurse educators can assess their current position and plan development accordingly.

**3. Teaching with AI**
Practical strategies for using GenAI in teaching, including:
- Generating diverse patient scenarios for simulation
- Creating visual aids (anatomical diagrams, concept maps)
- Developing formative assessment questions with varied difficulty levels
- Producing accessible versions of learning materials

**4. Learning with AI**
Guidance for students on productive AI engagement, emphasising that AI should enhance critical thinking rather than replace it. This includes structured reflection templates and approaches to verifying AI-generated information against authoritative sources.

**5. Assessment and Feedback**
Strategies for redesigning assessment in the context of GenAI, moving from detection-focused approaches to assessment designs that incorporate AI use transparently. This includes approaches such as process portfolios, oral components, and AI-assisted drafting with critical analysis.

**6. Platform Selection**
A comparison of available GenAI tools relevant to nursing education, considering factors such as data security, NHS-approved status, accessibility features, and cost.

**7. Design Framework**
A pedagogical framework for planning multimodal AI-enhanced learning, ensuring alignment between learning outcomes, AI tools, and assessment methods.

### The 'Nurse Citizen Developer' Concept

Central to the toolkit's philosophy is the concept of the 'Nurse Citizen Developer'—a nurse who actively shapes and adapts technology rather than passively consuming it. This concept challenges the traditional positioning of nurses as end-users of systems designed by others.

The toolkit argues that nurses bring unique perspectives to AI development: understanding of clinical workflows, commitment to patient safety, and expertise in person-centred communication. These contributions are essential for creating AI tools that genuinely serve healthcare needs.

## Application in Practice

### Case Study: Virtual Patient Scenarios

One practical application demonstrated in the toolkit is the generation of virtual patient scenarios. Traditionally, developing realistic patient cases for simulation is time-intensive. GenAI can accelerate this process while allowing customisation for specific learning objectives.

For example, an educator might use the following prompt structure:

> 'Create a patient scenario for a 75-year-old with type 2 diabetes presenting to a GP practice with a foot ulcer. Include relevant history, current medications, observations, and dialogue. The scenario should allow students to practice NEWS2 assessment and demonstrate awareness of diabetic foot complications. The patient should express anxiety about potential amputation.'

The toolkit provides guidance on reviewing and refining AI-generated scenarios, including checking clinical accuracy against NICE guidelines and ensuring person-centred language.

### Case Study: Person-Centred Language Checking

The toolkit includes guidance on using AI to identify and revise language that may inadvertently depersonalise patients. Drawing on FONS principles, this application helps students develop sensitivity to the impact of clinical language on therapeutic relationships.

Students learn to prompt AI systems to analyse their written work for phrases that objectify patients (e.g., 'the diabetic in bed 4'), replacing them with person-first alternatives (e.g., 'Mrs Ahmed, who has diabetes, in bed 4').

## Discussion

### Implications for Nurse Educators

The AI Educator Toolkit offers a starting point for nurse educators navigating an unfamiliar landscape. By providing structured guidance, practical examples, and alignment with professional standards, it reduces the barrier to engagement with GenAI.

The toolkit's emphasis on multimodal learning is particularly relevant for nursing education. Clinical practice requires nurses to integrate information from multiple sources simultaneously—monitors displaying vital signs, patients' verbal reports, visual assessment of wounds, and written care plans. By developing teaching materials that similarly integrate text, image, and interactive elements, educators can create learning experiences that more closely mirror the cognitive demands of practice.

The timing of this resource is significant. Many institutions have responded to GenAI with prohibition or silence, neither of which serves students well. Prohibition is increasingly difficult to enforce and may be counterproductive, potentially driving AI use underground rather than fostering transparent, reflective engagement. Silence leaves students without guidance, increasing risks of inappropriate use or over-reliance.

The toolkit provides a third option: structured integration that acknowledges AI as a reality while maintaining professional standards. This approach prepares students for workplaces where AI tools are increasingly common, from electronic health records with predictive algorithms to decision support systems and automated monitoring.

### Educator Development Needs

Implementing AI-enhanced education requires educator development. Many nurse educators report limited confidence with emerging technologies, and institutional support for professional development is often constrained. The toolkit addresses this by providing ready-to-use resources that require minimal technical expertise, reducing the learning curve for educators new to GenAI.

However, resources alone are insufficient. Institutional cultures must support experimentation and accept that early attempts may be imperfect. Communities of practice, where educators share experiences and learn from one another, can accelerate adoption and improvement. The open-access nature of the toolkit—published under Creative Commons licensing—enables such sharing and collaborative development.

### Student Perspectives

While the toolkit focuses on educators, student perspectives are crucial. Research indicates that nursing students are already using GenAI tools, often daily, for study and assignment preparation. Many report finding these tools helpful for understanding complex concepts, generating practice questions, and improving written expression.

However, students also report concerns about accuracy, over-reliance, and uncertainty about what constitutes appropriate use. Clear guidance from educators—not prohibition but structured integration—can address these concerns while developing critical evaluation skills that will serve students throughout their careers.

### Addressing Concerns

Common concerns about AI in education include academic integrity, accuracy ('hallucinations'), bias, and over-reliance. The toolkit addresses each directly:

**Academic integrity:** The traditional framing of academic integrity focuses on detecting and preventing prohibited behaviours. In the context of widely available AI tools, this framing may be insufficient. The toolkit advocates for transparent AI use policies where students declare and reflect upon their AI usage, shifting focus from detection to development of ethical judgement.

Assessment designs can incorporate AI use explicitly, requiring students to demonstrate critical evaluation of AI outputs. For example, students might be asked to generate AI responses to clinical scenarios, then critique those responses against professional guidelines and research evidence. This approach treats AI as a learning tool while developing skills employers increasingly value.

**Accuracy and hallucinations:** All AI-generated clinical content must be verified against authoritative sources. The toolkit provides structured approaches to verification, teaching students to cross-reference AI outputs with sources such as NICE guidelines, British National Formulary entries, and Cochrane reviews.

This verification requirement serves multiple purposes: it develops research skills, reinforces the primacy of evidence-based practice, and models the critical stance nurses must maintain toward any information source, human or artificial.

**Bias:** AI systems can perpetuate and amplify biases present in their training data. In healthcare contexts, this includes racial bias in clinical imagery—for example, dermatological AI trained predominantly on light skin may perform poorly on darker skin tones. The toolkit highlights the work of nurse developers addressing these issues, including research on skin tone bias in wound assessment photography.

Educators are encouraged to explicitly discuss bias with students, using AI-generated materials as opportunities for critical analysis. Questions such as 'Whose perspective might be missing here?' and 'How might this output differ for different patient populations?' develop the equity lens essential for person-centred care.

**Over-reliance:** Perhaps the most significant concern is that AI dependence may erode the clinical reasoning, communication, and empathic engagement that define nursing practice. The toolkit emphasises that AI should augment, not replace, these core competencies.

Practically, this means designing learning activities where AI handles routine tasks (synthesising background information, generating practice questions) while students focus on higher-order skills (clinical decision-making, therapeutic communication, ethical reasoning). This division of labour mirrors how AI is likely to function in clinical settings: supporting rather than supplanting professional judgement.

### Ethical Considerations

Beyond practical concerns, AI in nursing education raises deeper ethical questions. Whose interests do AI systems serve? How do we ensure equitable access to AI-enhanced education? What are educators' responsibilities when AI tools change faster than curricula?

The toolkit does not resolve these questions definitively but provides frameworks for considering them. The 'Nurse Citizen Developer' concept encourages nurses to engage actively with technology development, ensuring nursing values shape AI tools rather than accepting systems designed without nursing input.

Professional bodies' guidance—from the ICN, RCN, and NMC—emphasises that AI must serve human flourishing. This aligns with nursing's fundamental commitment to person-centred care. AI tools that enhance nurses' capacity to provide compassionate, individualised care are consistent with professional values; tools that mechanise or depersonalise care are not.

### Limitations

This paper describes a resource rather than reporting empirical evaluation of its effectiveness. Future work should assess the toolkit's impact on educator confidence, changes to teaching practice, and ultimately student learning outcomes and preparedness for AI-augmented practice.

The toolkit was contextualised for UK nursing education and reflects UK regulatory and professional frameworks. Educators in other countries may find the pedagogical approaches transferable but will need to adapt regulatory references for their contexts.

Additionally, the rapid evolution of GenAI means that specific tool recommendations and usage examples may become outdated. The toolkit's open-access model allows for ongoing updates, but users should verify current information, particularly regarding data security and institutional policies.

## Conclusion

As GenAI becomes increasingly embedded in healthcare and education, nurse educators must prepare students for AI-augmented practice. The AI Educator Toolkit provides a freely accessible, professionally aligned resource for integrating multimodal GenAI into UK nursing curricula.

The NMC's planned revision of the Code to address AI (expected 2027) signals professional recognition of this imperative. However, education cannot wait for regulation. By engaging with resources such as this toolkit, nurse educators can begin preparing the next generation of nurses now—critically, ethically, and in service of person-centred care.
