The rapid evolution of Generative AI challenges traditional essay-based assessment. This section explores how nursing education can move from "policing" students (which is increasingly inaccurate) to "designing" assessments that are authentic and AI-resilient.

## The Paradigm Shift

| Traditional Assessment | AI-Era Assessment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product-Focused** | **Process-Focused** |
| "Write an essay about..." | "Critique this AI essay about..." |
| Testing recall of facts | Testing application of knowledge in novel contexts |
| Written only | Multimodal (Video, Audio, Diagram, Viva) |

## Key Principles
1.  **AI Resilience**: Design tasks that rely on human-specific skills (emotional intelligence, reflection on practice, real-time clinical reasoning).
2.  **Assessment FOR Learning**: Use AI to give students immediate formative feedback to improve their work *before* submission.
3.  **Authenticity**: Simulate real-world nursing tasks (e.g., handover, discharge planning) rather than abstract academic tasks.

:::warning AI Detection Tools
Research (e.g., Weber-Wulff et al.) suggests that AI detection software is unreliable and prone to false positives, especially against non-native English speakers. **Focus on assessment design, not detection software.**
