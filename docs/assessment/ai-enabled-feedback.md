AI can be a powerful tool for **formative feedback**—giving students guidance on how to improve *before* they submit their final work.

:::danger PRIVACY WARNING (GDPR)
**Educators**: NEVER upload student work (assignments, reflections) into a public AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) unless you have a paid, "Zero-Data-Retention" enterprise agreement.
Uploading student work without their explicit consent acts as a data breach.
:::

## 1. The "Pre-Flight Check" (Student-Led)
Encourage *students* to use AI to check their own work before submission. This frees up educators to focus on the content, not the grammar.

**Prompt for Students**:
> "Act as an academic proofreader. Review my essay for:
> 1. Clarity of argument.
> 2. Passive voice usage.
> 3. Logical flow.
> Do NOT rewrite the essay. Just give me a list of improvements."

## 2. Rubric Alignment
Students can check if they have met the marking criteria.

**Prompt for Students**:
> "Here is the marking rubric for a 'Distinction' level.
> Here is my draft introduction.
> Does my introduction meet the criteria? If not, what is missing?"

## 3. Feedback Generation (Enterprise Safe ONLY)
*If and only if* your institution provides a secure, private AI instance (e.g., Microsoft Copilot with Commercial Data Protection):
Educators can paste a specific section of a student's work to generate constructive feedback phrases.

**Prompt**:
> "Suggest 3 constructive ways to phrase feedback for a student who has described a clinical procedure well but failed to reference the underlying evidence base."

## Feedback vs. Marking
*   **AI** is faster at checking syntax, structure, and breadth.
*   **Humans** are better at checking nuance, clinical safety, and "voice".
*   **Rule**: AI can Support the marker, but it should never Repace the marker.

:::warning Bias Check
AI models can be biased against non-standard English dialects. Ensure feedback does not unfairly penalize students relying on global English variations.
