# AI in Nursing Education: A Multimodal Learning Toolkit

## About This Toolkit

Welcome! I'm **Lincoln Gombedza, RN (LD)**, and I've created this toolkit to help UK nursing educators harness the potential of Generative AI whilst maintaining the rigorous standards our profession demands.

This work builds upon the foundational research of **Tünde Varga-Atkins, Samuel Saunders, and colleagues** in their excellent "Educators' guide to multimodal learning and Generative AI" (2024/25)[^1]. I have adapted and contextualised their insights for UK nursing education, integrating NMC standards, clinical examples, and person-centred care principles.

**To All Nurse Educators**:
- Every nurse educator experimenting with AI in their teaching — You are shaping the future of nursing education

Their collective work has shown that nurses can—and should—shape the AI tools we use, rather than simply accepting what is built for us.

## Welcome to the AI Educator Toolkit

This toolkit presents strategies and techniques for the incorporation of Generative AI (GenAI) in multimodal forms of teaching, learning, and assessment in **nursing education**. It focuses on the intersection of multimodal learning and GenAI and is written for both educators and educational developers, who play a pivotal role in modelling pedagogical innovation and guiding colleagues through evolving landscapes of teaching and learning.

## Our Nursing Position on Generative AI

As nurses and nursing educators, our position on AI must reflect the professional, ethical, and clinical realities of our practice. This toolkit aligns with guidance from the **International Council of Nurses (ICN)**, **Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC)**, and **Royal College of Nursing (RCN)**.

### Core Principles

**1. Nurses Must Lead, Not Follow**  
The ICN (2025) is unequivocal: nurses must be "actively engaged and lead in all phases of AI solution development, implementation, and evaluation." We are not passive recipients of technology—we are **Nurse Citizen Developers** who shape the tools we use.

**2. AI Augments, Never Replaces, Nursing Judgement**  
The RCN (October 2025) states that "AI has significant potential to modernise services but must enhance, rather than replace, personal nursing care." AI does not replace a nurse's critical thinking, clinical judgement, empathy, or the therapeutic relationship. It is a **supportive tool**, not a substitute for human connection.

**3. Patient Safety and Accountability Remain with Nurses**  
The American Nurses Association (2025) Code of Ethics is clear: nurses remain accountable for all clinical decisions, even when AI contributes to diagnosis or monitoring. We must verify AI-generated information against authoritative sources (NICE, BNF, NMC standards) and never outsource our professional responsibility.

**4. Ethical Vigilance is Non-Negotiable**  
AI systems can perpetuate bias, especially around skin tone in wound assessment, diagnostic algorithms, and triage tools. The ICN emphasises "vigilance against data bias" and "ensuring transparency and accountability." As nurses, we advocate for health equity and must scrutinise AI for fairness.

**5. Education Now, Regulation Coming**  
The NMC is reviewing its Code to include AI standards (consultation 2026, publication 2027). However, **digital literacy is already a foundational requirement** in NMC pre-registration standards. We cannot wait for regulation—we must equip students with critical AI literacy now.

### Our Pragmatic Approach

We adopt what Vallor (2024) calls **"a middle way"**: neither uncritical enthusiasm nor outright rejection. AI is here—students already use it, healthcare systems are deploying it, and patients expect it. Our role as educators is to:

- **Model responsible use** — Show students how to use AI ethically and effectively
- **Teach critical evaluation** — Equip students to identify hallucinations, bias, and limitations
- **Preserve humanistic care** — Ensure AI enhances, rather than erodes, compassion and connection
- **Prepare for the future** — AI fluency is now a core nursing competency alongside clinical skills

:::caution Our Commitment
We do not believe that discussing AI means uncritically endorsing it. Rather, we believe that **ignoring AI does students a disservice**. Future nurses will work in AI-augmented healthcare systems. Our responsibility is to prepare them to use AI safely, ethically, and in service of person-centred care.

## Why Multimodal Learning Matters in Nursing

Digital technologies have both intensified and shone a light on the inherently multimodal nature of modern society — where learning and communication extend beyond text and speech to include the visual, aural, or tactile (Kress, 2009; Cope & Kalantzis, 2024).

**For nursing education specifically**, multimodal approaches are essential because:

- **Clinical practice is multimodal** — Nurses communicate through verbal reports, written documentation, visual assessments, and physical demonstrations
- **Patient-centred care requires multiple forms of expression** — Understanding and responding to patients' needs through various communication modes
- **Learning styles vary** — Different students grasp complex clinical concepts through different modalities
- **Professional standards demand it** — NMC standards emphasize effective communication across multiple modes

As Generative AI technology becomes increasingly embedded in everyday life, it is vital for nursing education to design multimodal learning, teaching, and assessment approaches that foster students' ability to think both critically and effectively in a digitally mediated context.

## Multimodal Learning in Context

In a multimodal learning environment, educators aim to move beyond text-dominant formats, and instead incorporate and combine a variety of communication forms to better support student learning. Digital multimodal learning involves designing learning activities that draw on multimodal artefacts and utilise a combination of 'semiotic technologies'.

These technologies help to combine image, sound, touch and other modes into multimodal artefacts that are better than single-mode artefacts for meaning-making (Kress, 2009; van Leeuwen, 2017), commonly a combination of verbal and some other mode of expression.

### Examples in Nursing Education:

- **Infographics** — Anatomical diagrams with labels and explanatory text
- **Digital posters** — Research presentations combining data, images, and narrative
- **Videos** — Clinical skills demonstrations with narration
- **Virtual simulations** — Interactive patient scenarios
- **Inquiry graphics** — Visual representations of clinical reasoning processes

A key aspect of multimodality is the way that different modes are assembled (e.g. text and image in an infographic). This assembly provides extra meaning beyond the sum of its parts, and informs interactions and discussions in the nursing education context.

## What's in This Guide?

The guide is organized into several key sections:

1. **Responsible Use of AI** — Ethical considerations, costs, and sustainability
2. **Developing AI Literacy** — Building competencies at individual, module, programme, and institutional levels
3. **Teaching with AI** — Creating and delivering multimodal nursing education content
4. **Learning with AI** — How students can engage with GenAI for deeper understanding
5. **Assessment & Feedback** — Reimagining evaluation in the age of AI
6. **Choosing Platforms** — Guidance on selecting appropriate GenAI tools
7. **Design Model** — A framework for integrating multimodal GenAI into nursing curricula

Throughout, you'll find **nursing-specific case studies**, **practical examples**, and **ready-to-use prompt templates** tailored for UK nursing education contexts.
