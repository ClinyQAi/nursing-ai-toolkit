# Introduction to Multimodal Learning and Generative AI

## About This Toolkit

Welcome! I'm **Lincoln Gombedza, RN (LD)**, and I've created this toolkit to help UK nursing educators harness the potential of Generative AI whilst maintaining the rigorous standards our profession demands.

This work builds upon the foundational research of **Tünde Varga-Atkins, Samuel Saunders, and colleagues** in their excellent "Educators' guide to multimodal learning and Generative AI" (2024/25)[^1]. I have adapted and contextualised their insights for UK nursing education, integrating NMC standards, clinical examples, and person-centred care principles.

### Acknowledgments

This toolkit would not exist without the pioneering work and inspiration of:

**Academic Foundation**:
- **Tünde Varga-Atkins, Samuel Saunders, et al.** — For their comprehensive guide to multimodal learning and GenAI, published under CC BY-NC 4.0 licence[^1]

**Nurse Citizen Developer Pioneers**:
- **Joanne Bosanquet** — For championing digital innovation and person-centred language in nursing practice
- **Kumbi Kariwo** — For demonstrating how nurses can lead technological transformation
- **The wider Nurse Citizen Developer community** — For proving that nurses are not passive technology users, but active creators and innovators

Their collective work has shown that nurses can—and should—shape the AI tools we use, rather than simply accepting what is built for us.

## Welcome to the AI Educator Toolkit

This toolkit presents strategies and techniques for the incorporation of Generative AI (GenAI) in multimodal forms of teaching, learning, and assessment in **nursing education**. It focuses on the intersection of multimodal learning and GenAI and is written for both educators and educational developers, who play a pivotal role in modelling pedagogical innovation and guiding colleagues through evolving landscapes of teaching and learning.

## Our Position on Generative AI

At this initial stage, it is important to outline our position on the presence and use of GenAI in higher education. Whilst 'Artificial Intelligence' has existed in different forms for decades, the appearance and accessibility of GenAI since the release of the first iteration of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022 have enhanced its usability in learning and teaching contexts, and has solidified GenAI as an emerging frontier in the application of AI in education.

However, in this Guide, we opt for a **pragmatic approach** to the technology. We are not uncritical 'techno-fixers' or over-enthusiastic adopters of GenAI, and nor do we view Generative AI technology as the ultimate destroyer of higher education. Rather, and as Vallor (2024) eloquently puts it, we contend that AI is a 'mirror machine' that reflects ourselves back at us, and, just like Vallor, we wish to provide educators, educational developers and students with an approach that gives them:

> "a middle way between passive resignation to AI technology as a replacement for human agency and rejecting AI as an existential threat that must be opposed and defeated" (Vallor, 2024).

Part of the challenge of examining GenAI in educational contexts is the tension between its speed of development and evolution, and its already-entrenched position in pedagogy, as well as its endorsement by national and educational institutions. On the one hand, even as we write this guide, GenAI is advancing rapidly. On the other hand, Generative AI is already 'here to stay'; students, staff, professionals, lay-users, and the public all use Generative AI in their daily lives – sometimes without realising it.

:::caution Important
We do not believe that talking about Generative AI is the same as uncritically endorsing the use of Generative AI. We do not necessarily endorse Generative AI in educational contexts at every opportunity. Rather, we contend that wilfully ignoring it and/or actively rejecting it does students a disservice, and will ultimately make them more likely to misunderstand the technology in future contexts.

## Why Multimodal Learning Matters in Nursing

Digital technologies have both intensified and shone a light on the inherently multimodal nature of modern society — where learning and communication extend beyond text and speech to include the visual, aural, or tactile (Kress, 2009; Cope & Kalantzis, 2024).

**For nursing education specifically**, multimodal approaches are essential because:

- **Clinical practice is multimodal** — Nurses communicate through verbal reports, written documentation, visual assessments, and physical demonstrations
- **Patient-centred care requires multiple forms of expression** — Understanding and responding to patients' needs through various communication modes
- **Learning styles vary** — Different students grasp complex clinical concepts through different modalities
- **Professional standards demand it** — NMC standards emphasize effective communication across multiple modes

As Generative AI technology becomes increasingly embedded in everyday life, it is vital for nursing education to design multimodal learning, teaching, and assessment approaches that foster students' ability to think both critically and effectively in a digitally mediated context.

## Multimodal Learning in Context

In a multimodal learning environment, educators aim to move beyond text-dominant formats, and instead incorporate and combine a variety of communication forms to better support student learning. Digital multimodal learning involves designing learning activities that draw on multimodal artefacts and utilise a combination of 'semiotic technologies'.

These technologies help to combine image, sound, touch and other modes into multimodal artefacts that are better than single-mode artefacts for meaning-making (Kress, 2009; van Leeuwen, 2017), commonly a combination of verbal and some other mode of expression.

### Examples in Nursing Education:

- **Infographics** — Anatomical diagrams with labels and explanatory text
- **Digital posters** — Research presentations combining data, images, and narrative
- **Videos** — Clinical skills demonstrations with narration
- **Virtual simulations** — Interactive patient scenarios
- **Inquiry graphics** — Visual representations of clinical reasoning processes

A key aspect of multimodality is the way that different modes are assembled (e.g. text and image in an infographic). This assembly provides extra meaning beyond the sum of its parts, and informs interactions and discussions in the nursing education context.

## What's in This Guide?

The guide is organized into several key sections:

1. **Responsible Use of AI** — Ethical considerations, costs, and sustainability
2. **Developing AI Literacy** — Building competencies at individual, module, programme, and institutional levels
3. **Teaching with AI** — Creating and delivering multimodal nursing education content
4. **Learning with AI** — How students can engage with GenAI for deeper understanding
5. **Assessment & Feedback** — Reimagining evaluation in the age of AI
6. **Choosing Platforms** — Guidance on selecting appropriate GenAI tools
7. **Design Model** — A framework for integrating multimodal GenAI into nursing curricula

Throughout, you'll find **nursing-specific case studies**, **practical examples**, and **ready-to-use prompt templates** tailored for UK nursing education contexts.
