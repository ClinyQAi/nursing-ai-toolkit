## 1. ⏱️ Save Time with Smart Use of AI Tools

Educators can free up valuable time by using GenAI to streamline resource creation and administrative tasks.

### What You Can Do:

**Content Creation**:
- Generate care pathway diagrams for lectures
- Create copyright-free anatomical illustrations
- Build slides quickly for presentations
- Develop training materials and lesson plans

**Assessment Materials**:
- Create quiz questions aligned with NMC competencies
- Generate OSCE scenarios
- Develop reflection prompts
- Build marking rubrics

**Accessibility**:
- Convert documents into audio formats
- Create study guides from lecture notes
- Generate FAQs from course materials
- Produce explainer videos using animated characters

### Nursing-Specific Examples:

**Example 1: Quick Quiz Generation**
```
Prompt (for Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5, or Claude Sonnet 4): 
"Create 10 multiple-choice questions to assess Year 2 nursing students' 
understanding of hypertension management, aligned with NICE guidelines CG127. 
Include rationales for correct answers."
```

**Example 2: Care Pathway Conversion**
```
Prompt (for Gemini 3 Pro or GPT-5): 
"Convert this diabetes Type 2 management NICE guideline into a visual 
flowchart showing decision points for medication escalation. Use Mermaid diagram 
syntax."
```

**Example 3: Accessibility Enhancement**
```
Prompt (for any LLM): 
"Summarize this 20-page lecture on wound healing and create a podcast 
script (8-10 minutes) suitable for students with dyslexia or those who prefer 
audio learning."
```

:::tip Time-Saving Tip
If you're short on time, GenAI software can potentially convert existing documents into study aids or activities—such as FAQs, quizzes, or dedicated study guides—automatically.

## 2. 🪞 Mirror AI Use: Show Your Process

Model transparency by showing students how YOU use GenAI tools in your own workflow. This builds trust and teaches responsible use.

### How to Mirror AI Use:

**In Lectures**:
- Share your screen while crafting prompts
- Show iterations—explain why you refined a prompt
- Demonstrate how you verify AI outputs against NICE/NMC sources
- Discuss what worked and what didn't

**In Assignments**:
- Require students to document their AI use
- Ask them to submit prompts alongside outputs
- Have them reflect on why they chose to use AI (or not)
- Encourage critical commentary on AI limitations

**In Assessment Feedback**:
- Show students how you might use AI to generate draft feedback
- Demonstrate how you personalize and refine it
- Explain what you verify and change

### Activity: Compare AI vs Human Content

Use class time to compare AI-created content with human-created content. This sparks rich discussion and teaches students to evaluate outputs critically.

**Nursing Example**:
1. Show an AI-generated care plan
2. Show a care plan written by an experienced nurse
3. Ask students to identify differences
4. Discuss: What did AI miss? What did it get right? What needs human judgment?

:::tip Modeling Authentic Use
> "I show my students my ChatGPT conversation history when I'm creating patient scenarios. They see my prompts, the AI's responses, and my edits. It demystifies the process." — Nursing educator

This authentic modeling helps students understand that AI is  a tool for drafting and ideation, not a final product.

## 3. ✅ Use Checklists to Guide Ethical & Sustainable AI Use

Before sharing or submitting AI-generated materials, use a checklist to ensure responsible use.

### Essential Checklist Questions:

#### **Clinical Accuracy**:
- [ ] Have I verified this against authoritative sources (NICE, NMC, BNF, Cochrane)?
- [ ] Are anatomical details/physiological processes correct?
- [ ] Are medication doses, routes, and frequencies accurate?
- [ ] Does this align with current evidence-based practice?

#### **Ethical Considerations**:
- [ ] Does this content include sensitive or copyrighted information?
- [ ] Could this image or text unintentionally reinforce a stereotype?
- [ ] Is this the best use of AI, or is it just the most convenient?
- [ ] Have I respected patient confidentiality (no real patient data in prompts)?

#### **Bias & Representation**:
- [ ] Does this represent diverse patient populations appropriately?
- [ ] Are different ethnic backgrounds, ages, and genders represented?
- [ ] Does the language promote dignity and person-centred care?
- [ ] Could this perpetuate health inequalities or biases?

#### **Sustainability**:
- [ ] Is this AI use necessary and meaningful?
- [ ] Am I avoiding elaborate or purely decorative image generations?
- [ ] Have I considered the carbon cost of this generation?

#### **Data Protection**:
- [ ] Am I using institutional AI tools (not public ChatGPT for sensitive data)?
- [ ] Have I removed any identifiable patient information from prompts?
- [ ] Am I complying with NHS Data Security Protection Toolkit?
- [ ] Does this meet Caldicott Principles?

:::warning Critical for Nursing
**NEVER input**:
- Real patient names, NHS numbers, or identifiable data
- Student grades or personal information
- Unpublished research data
- Confidential trust information

**Use instead**:
- Institutional AI tools with data protection
- Anonymized case examples
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Public domain information

## 4. 🤝 Design for Human-AI Collaboration, Not Substitution

Think of AI as a co-pilot, not a chauffeur. The goal is to augment human capability, not replace it.

### Principles of Human-AI Collaboration:

#### **AI does**:
- Generate drafts and prototypes
- Offer multiple alternatives quickly
- Process large amounts of information
- Create multimodal representations

#### **Humans do**:
- Provide clinical judgment and expertise
- Apply ethical reasoning and accountability
- Add nuance, context, and care
- Make final decisions and verify accuracy

### Nursing Education Examples:

**Example 1: Care Planning**
- **AI role**: Generate initial care plan framework based on patient scenario
- **Student role**: Personalize for individual patient, apply clinical reasoning, verify interventions, demonstrate critical thinking

**Example 2: Pathophysiology Learning**
- **AI role**: Create visual diagram of disease process
- **Student role**: Explain the diagram, identify clinical implications, relate to practice, critique accuracy

**Example 3: Interview Preparation**
- **AI role**: Generate potential interview questions from job description
- **Student role**: Practice responses aloud using voice feature, refine delivery and tone, demonstrate professional communication

:::tip Frame GenAI as a "Thinking Partner"
Make it clear that students must do the intellectual heavy lifting—they can use GenAI to get help going from A to B, but not to skip from A to Z.

**Assignment instructions should specify**:
- What AI can help with (brainstorming, drafting, formatting)
- What AI cannot replace (critical analysis, clinical judgment, reflection)
- How to document AI use transparently

## 5. 📚 Teach AI Literacy as a Core Skill

Don't assume students (or colleagues) know how to use AI effectively or responsibly. Build in explicit teaching about AI literacy.

### What to Teach:

#### **Prompt Engineering**:
- The clearer the input, the better the result
- Teach students to be specific and detailed
- Practice iterative refinement of prompts
- Show examples of poor vs. excellent prompts

**Activity**: Prompt Engineering Challenge
```
Give students this scenario: "You need AI to generate a patient scenario for 
practicing medication administration."

Poor prompt: "Create a patient scenario"

Good prompt: "Create a realistic patient scenario for a 68-year-old patient 
with atrial fibrillation prescribed warfarin. Include relevant medical history, 
current medications, vital signs, and INR result. The scenario should require 
the student to: 1) Check INR and determine if warfarin dose needs adjustment, 
2) Provide patient education about warfarin, 3) Identify signs of bleeding 
complications."

Have students compare the outputs!
```

#### **Tool Strengths & Limitations**:
- Some tools provide sources (Perplexity AI, Bing Chat with citations)
- Others don't (ChatGPT standard mode)
- AI can 'hallucinate' facts, especially in images
- Multimodal outputs may have hidden inaccuracies

#### **Critical Evaluation Skills**:
- Always verify clinical information
- Check for bias in representation
- Question oversimplifications
- Look for what's missing, not just what's present

### Incorporation Strategies:

**In Assignments**:
- **Week 1**: Intro to AI literacy (what it is, why it matters)
- **Week 3**: Hands-on prompt engineering workshop
- **Week 5**: Critical evaluation of AI outputs exercise
- **Week 10**: Reflection on personal AI use throughout module

**Tool-Specific Training**:
When asking students to use a specific tool (e.g., H5P for digital field notebooks, Padlet for collaboration), teach the platform first and check for accessibility needs.

:::tip Bonus Tip: Require Documentation
Ask students to document **how and why** they used AI in their work. This builds reflection and reinforces responsible habits.

**Example submission requirement**:
> "Along with your final care plan, submit a 200-word reflection on your use of GenAI. Include: (1) What prompts you used, (2) How you verified accuracy, (3) What you changed or rejected from AI outputs, (4) What you learned about AI limitations."
