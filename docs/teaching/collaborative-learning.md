Generative AI introduces a new dynamic to collaborative learning: the "non-human" collaborator. This section explores how to facilitate effective group work that includes AI tools.

## 1. AI as a "Team Member"
In group projects, AI can be assigned a specific role, such as "The Sceptic" or "The Note-Taker," to support the human students.

### Strategy: The "Devil's Advocate"
*   **Context**: A group of students is designing a quality improvement implementation plan.
*   **Action**: They feed their plan to an AI (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4) and ask it to identify **three potential points of failure** or **safety risks**.
*   **Outcome**: The group must then discuss these risks and refute them or adapt their plan.

## 2. Think-Pair-Share-AI
A modification of the classic teaching strategy:

1.  **Think**: Students reflect individually on a question (e.g., "What are the barriers to effective discharge planning?").
2.  **Pair**: They discuss with a partner.
3.  **Share**: They share with the wider group.
4.  **AI (New Step)**: The group asks an AI the same question and compares the AI's perspective with their own. *Did the AI miss the human/social aspects? Did the AI find a policy point the students missed?*

## 3. Risks of "Social Loafing"
There is a risk that students may over-rely on AI to do the "heavy lifting" in group work.

### Mitigation Strategies for Educators:
*   **Process over Product**: Assess the *discussion* and *prompting strategy*, not just the final output.
*   **Video Reflections**: Ask groups to record a 5-minute video explaining *how* they used AI and where they disagreed with it.
*   **"Human-In-The-Loop" Requirement**: Mandate that every AI-generated contribution must be annotated with a student's verification or critique.

## 4. Interdisciplinary Simulation
AI can simulate professionals from other fields to create interdisciplinary case conferences.

**Scenario**: Discharge planning for a patient with complex needs.
*   **Student Role**: The Nurse.
*   **AI Role 1**: The Social Worker (focus on funding/care act).
*   **AI Role 2**: The Occupational Therapist (focus on home adaptations).
*   **Activity**: The student must coordinate the discharge plan, synthesizing input from these AI "colleagues" while advocating for the patient's nursing needs.

:::tip Accessibility Note
Collaborative AI tools can be great levelers for students who face language barriers or neurodiverse challenges in group settings, providing a "safe" space to rehearse ideas before sharing with peers.
