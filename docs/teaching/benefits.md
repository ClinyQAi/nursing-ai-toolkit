Integrating multimodal teaching strategies and GenAI into nursing education presents significant opportunities for enhancing learning and fostering creativity. Based on extensive data-gathering from educators, the following compelling benefits have been identified— both pedagogical and practical.

## 1. Enhancing Pedagogy Through Diverse Modalities 🎨

Multimodal teaching can expand pedagogical possibilities by moving beyond traditional, text-centric formats. Introducing varied media—such as video, podcasts, infographics, interactive simulations, and performance-based tasks—can make learning more inclusive and engaging.

### Why This Matters for Nursing:

- **Different learning preferences** — Visual learners see diagrams, auditory learners hear explanations, kinesthetic learners interact with simulations
- **Real-world relevance** — Clinical practice itself is multimodal (verbal handovers, written charts, visual assessments)
- **Deeper engagement** — Students respond positively to tasks that feel authentic

Gen AI can amplify these possibilities by enabling faster content transposition—summarizing texts into visual formats or adapting materials into different media. This allows educators to more easily offer diverse entry points for learning.

**Nursing Example**:
- Convert a diabetes management lecture into a podcast for students to listen during commute
- Transform pathophysiology notes into animated explainer videos
- Create interactive care planning simulations
- Generate visual care pathways from NICE guideline text

## 2. Lowering Barriers to Multimodal Creation 🚀

While utilizing multimodal learning resources can be exciting, they often require skills in design, media production, or communication that educators or students may lack. GenAI can help level this playing field.

### How GenAI Helps:

- Educators without graphic design experience can generate professional imagery
- No need for costly software or specialist knowledge
- Can prototype materials or experiment with new formats quickly
- Allows wider range of educators to participate confidently in rich, multimodal tasks

**Nursing Example**:
> "I'm not a graphic designer, but I used DALL-E to create anatomical diagrams showing the stages of pressure ulcer development. My students said they were clearer than the textbook images!" — Nursing lecturer

**Before GenAI**:
- Hire graphic designer (cost + time)
- Use stock images (copyright issues, may not fit context)
- Spend hours learning Photoshop/Illustrator

**With GenAI**:
- Write detailed prompt
- Generate image in minutes
- Iterate and refine quickly
- Focus energy on pedagogical design

## 3. Boosting Creativity & Idea Generation 💡

One of the most consistently praised aspects of GenAI is its role as a creative partner. Whether brainstorming potential patient personas for a case study or offering variations of a visual care pathway, AI can prompt new directions that may not have occurred otherwise.

**How This Works in Nursing**:

### For Educators:
-Brainstorming clinical scenario variations
- Generating different ways to explain complex topics
- Creating diverse patient case studies representing different demographics
- Developing alternative assessment formats

### For Students:
- Exploring different care planning approaches
- Visualizing pathophysiology in multiple ways
- Generating practice questions for self-study
- Creating  presentation materials

**Example Prompt for Creative Brainstorming**:
```
I'm teaching Year 2 nursing students about respiratory assessment. Generate 5 
creative ways to help them remember the components of inspection, palpation, 
percussion, and auscultation. Include visual metaphors, mnemonics, and 
interactive activities.
```

## 4. Increasing Efficiency to Enable Human-Centred Teaching ⏱️

Time is an endless constraint for educators. GenAI can offer tangible efficiencies in planning, content creation, and feedback preparation.

### Where GenAI Saves Time:

- **Generating quiz questions** — Create practice MCQs aligned with learning outcomes
- **Reformatting content** — Convert lecture notes into different media
- **Producing draft scripts** — For videos, podcasts, or narrated presentations
- **Creating case studies** — Generate patient scenarios for discussion

**The Real Benefit**: 
These efficiencies free up educator time for more personalized interactions—mentoring, formative coaching, or supporting struggling students. GenAI creates space for what one participant called **"relationship-rich pedagogy"** where educators invest more in the human dimensions of teaching and learning.

**Nursing Example Time Savings**:

| Task | Traditional Time | With GenAI | Time Saved |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Creating 20 MCQ quiz questions | 60 min | 15 min | 75% |
| Designing anatomical diagram | 45 min | 10 min | 78% |
| Converting lecture to podcast script | 90 min | 20 min | 78% |
| Generating patient case studies (×5) | 120 min | 25 min | 79% |

**That's 4-5 hours per week saved** = More time for:
- Student support and pastoral care
- Research and scholarship
- Professional development
- Work-life balance

## 5. Enhancing Student Interest & Engagement 🎯

Multimodal tasks, especially those involving creative output, often spark student interest and engagement. Alternative formats energize classroom participation.

### What Nursing Educators Observed:

✅ **Increased participation** in activities using visual or interactive formats  
✅ **Greater sense of empowerment** when students use GenAI to enhance their outputs  
✅ **More enthusiasm** for assignments allowing creative expression  
✅ **Better attendance** at sessions with hands-on, multimodal components

**Student Quotes** (adapted from focus groups):

> "I finally understood the cardiac cycle when I created an animated diagram using AI. Seeing it move helped me grasp the sequence." — Year 1 student

> "Using ChatGPT to generate practice scenarios helped me prepare for OSCEs. I could practice anytime, anywhere." — Year 3 student

> "The visual care pathway we created as a group was so much more meaningful than just writing an essay." — Year 2 student

### Important Note:

Engagement must be scaffolded—not all students immediately embrace novel media. Success requires:
- Clear instructions and expectations
- Visibility of value (how it helps their learning)
- Choice and autonomy where possible
- Support for those less confident with technology

## 6. Preparing Students for AI-Augmented Healthcare 🏥

By incorporating Generative AI into multimodal learning, nursing educators better position students with crucial skills for their future professional practice.

### Skills Students Develop:

1. **Prompt engineering** — Crafting precise requests for information or content
2. **Critical evaluation** — Assessing AI outputs for accuracy and bias
3. **Ethical decision-making** — Understanding appropriate vs inappropriate AI use
4. **Reflective practice** — Documenting and questioning their own AI use

### Why This Matters:

:::tip Future of Nursing
Healthcare is rapidly adopting AI technologies:
- AI-assisted diagnostics
- Predictive patient monitoring
- Automated documentation systems
- Clinical decision support tools

**Nurses who understand AI will be better equipped to**:
- Work safely alongside AI systems
- Advocate for patients when AI fails
- Contribute to AI implementation decisions
- Lead digital transformation in healthcare
:::

**Example NHS AI Applications Nurses Encounter**:
- AI-powered early warning scores (NEWS2 automation)
- Predictive algorithms for sepsis detection
- AI-assisted wound assessment tools
- Natural language processing for clinical notes

By exposing students to GenAI in educational settings, they learn to **explore and question AI's role in a safe, guided environment** before encountering it in high-stakes clinical practice.
