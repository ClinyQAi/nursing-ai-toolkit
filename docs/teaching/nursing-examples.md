This page acts as a "Prompt Library" for nursing educators. These prompts are designed for advanced models like **Gemini 3 Pro**, **GPT-5**, or **Claude Sonnet 4**.

## 1. Scenario Generation
Save time writing realistic clinical vignettes for seminars or exams.

### Template
> "Create a realistic clinical scenario for a [Year/Level] nursing student focusing on [Topic].
>
> **Patient Profile**: [Age, Gender, background].
> **Condition**: [Main condition] with comorbidity of [Comorbidity].
> **Social Context**: [Living situation/social factors].
> **Clinical Data**: Include 5 relevant vital signs (some deteriorating).
>
> **Output format**: Standard SBAR handover format.
> **Constraint**: Align with [NICE Guideline X] and ensure person-centred language."

### Example (Wound Care)
> "Create a realistic scenario for a Year 2 student focusing on pressure ulcer assessment.
> Patient: 82yo male, immobile following CVA.
> Context: Nursing home resident, dehydrated.
> Data: Waterlow score, wound description (Grade 3), nutritional status.
> Output: A handover script from a care assistant to the district nurse."

## 2. Lesson Planning Assistant
Generate active learning plans for dry topics.

### Template
> "I am teaching a 1-hour seminar on [Topic] to [Student Group].
> The learning objective is: [Learning Outcome].
>
> Create a lesson plan that uses **Active Learning** strategies.
> Include:
> 1. An icebreaker activity (5 mins).
> 2. A main group activity solving a problem (30 mins).
> 3. A plenary/summary activity (10 mins).
>
> Suggest one aspect where we could use Gemini/ChatGPT as a teaching aid."

## 3. Reflective Model Guide
Help students structure their reflection (without writing it for them).

### Template
> "I am a student nurse trying to write a reflection on a difficult communication encounter using the **Gibbs Reflective Cycle**.
>
> **Do NOT write the reflection for me.**
>
> Instead, act as a mentor. Ask me one question for each stage of the cycle (Description, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, Action Plan) to help me extract my thoughts. Wait for my answer before asking the next question."

## 4. Converting Complex Text to Easy Read
Essential for Learning Disability nursing and patient education.

### Template
> "Rewrite the following medical explanation of [Condition/Procedure] into **Easy Read** format.
>
> *   Use simple sentences.
> *   Avoid jargon.
> *   Bullet points for key actions.
> *   Suggest an image description for each point that I could create or find."

:::tip Pro Tip
Always iterate. If the first output isn't right, treat the AI like a colleague and say: *"That's good, but can you make the patient more acute?"* or *"That's too complex, simplify the language."*
