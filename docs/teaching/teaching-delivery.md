## 🗣️ Method 1: The Socratic Tutor

In a seminar, students can engage with a chatbot that has been instructed *not* to give the answer, but to ask probing questions regarding a case.

:::note 🏥 Nursing Application: Clinical Reasoning
**Activity**: Students present a "patient with worsening COPD" to the AI.
**Goal**: The AI challenges their prioritization without giving the answer.
:::

### 📝 Prompt Template
:::tip Teacher Prompt
"Act as a senior practice supervisor. I am a student nurse. I am going to present a patient case. **Do not tell me the correct interventions.** Instead, ask me 3 probing questions about my assessment findings to help me decide on the priority action myself. Give me feedback on my answers."
:::

## 🎭 Method 2: Real-Time Roleplay

GenAI's ability to simulate personas makes it powerful for "low-stakes" rehearsal of communication skills before patient contact.

:::note 🏥 Nursing Application: Taking a History
**Scenario**: A patient who is reluctant to disclose their alcohol intake.
**Activity**: Students use **Voice Mode** (ChatGPT/Gemini) to interview the patient.
**Review**: The class analyzes the transcript to see which questions built rapport.
:::

## 🕵️ Method 3: The Hallucination Hunt

To build AI literacy, integrate the *fallibility* of AI into the teaching session.

### 📋 Activity Steps
1.  **Generate**: Ask AI to write a short explanation of "The pathophysiology of Sepsis".
2.  **Verify**: Students must verify every claim against the **Royal Marsden Manual**.
3.  **Correct**: Highlight errors or vague statements.

> **NMC Proficiency 1.15**: "demonstrate the ability to critically analyse and evaluate evidence..."

## 💡 Method 4: Explaining Concepts

If a student struggles with a concept (e.g., pharmacokinetics), GenAI can instantly generate analogies.

### 📝 Prompt Template
:::tip Student Prompt
"Explain the concept of **[half-life]** to a **[Year 1 nursing student]** using an analogy related to **[making a cup of tea]**."

## 📊 Summary: AI Roles in Delivery

| Role | Function | Nursing Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎲 Possibility Engine** | Generates options/ideas | Generating differential diagnoses for discussion |
| **🦉 Socratic Opponent** | Challenges assumptions | Debating the ethics of a DNACPR decision |
| **🤝 Collaborator** | Co-creates work | Drafting a health promotion leaflet together |
| **🎭 Simulator** | Acts as patient/relative | Simulating a difficult conversation with a relative |

:::warning Clinical Safety
Always remind students that while AI is a useful simulator, it is not a substitute for clinical supervisor judgment. Real patients are more complex and nuanced.
