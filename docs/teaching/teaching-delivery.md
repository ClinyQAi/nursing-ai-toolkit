Beyond creating content, Generative AI can be an active participant in the delivery of teaching, supporting more dynamic, responsive, and personalized learning experiences.

## 1. The AI as "Socratic Tutor"
Instead of simply providing answers, AI can be prompted to guide students through a line of questioning to deepen their clinical reasoning.

### Nursing Application: Clinical Reasoning
In a seminar, students can engage with a chatbot (like Gemini 3 Pro or Claude Sonnet 4) that has been instructed *not* to give the answer, but to ask probing questions about a case.

**Example Prompt for Educator to set up:**
> "Act as a senior practice supervisor. I am a student nurse. I am going to present a patient with worsening COPD. Do not tell me the correct interventions. Instead, ask me 3 probing questions about my assessment findings to help me decide on the priority action myself. Give me feedback on my answers."

## 2. Real-Time Interactions & Roleplay
GenAI's ability to simulate personas makes it powerful for "low-stakes" rehearsal of communication skills before patient contact.

### Nursing Application: Taking a History
Students can use voice mode (on GPT-4o or Gemini Live) to "interview" a simulated patient.

**Scenario**: A patient who is reluctant to disclose their alcohol intake.
*   **Activity**: Students take turns asking questions.
*   **Review**: The class analyzes the transcript to discuss which questions built rapport versus which caused the "patient" to shut down.

## 3. Live Fact-Checking & critique
To build AI literacy, integrate the *fallibility* of AI into the teaching session.

### Activity: The "Hallucination Hunt"
1.  **Generate**: Ask the AI to write a short explanation of a complex topic (e.g., "The pathophysiology of Sepsis").
2.  **Verify**: Ask students to strictly verify the output against a trusted source (e.g., The Royal Marsden Manual or NICE Guidelines).
3.  **Correct**: Have students highlight errors or vague statements.

> **NMC Proficiency 1.15**: "demonstrate the ability to critically analyse and evaluate evidence..."

## 4. Explaining Concepts in Multiple Ways
If a student struggles with a concept (e.g., pharmacokinetics), GenAI can instantly generate analogies or simplify language.

**Prompt Template:**
> "Explain the concept of [half-life] to a [Year 1 nursing student] using an analogy related to [making tea/filling a bath]."

## 5. Summary Table: AI Roles in Delivery

| Role | Function | Nursing Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Possibility Engine** | Generates options/ideas | Generating differential diagnoses for discussion |
| **Socratic Opponent** | Challenges assumptions | Debating the ethics of a DNACPR decision |
| **Collaborator** | Co-creates work | Drafting a health promotion leaflet together |
| **Simulator** | Acts as patient/relative | Simulating a difficult conversation with a relative |

:::warning Clinical Safety
Always remind students that while AI is a useful simulator, it is not a substitute for clinical supervisor judgment. Real patients are more complex and nuanced.
