Generative AI (GenAI) tools significantly broaden the possibilities for multimodal teaching by enabling educators to design, adapt, and deliver content across a range of media. These technologies support not only the creation of multimodal artefacts such as images, audio, video, and interactive simulations, but also the transposition of content from one format to another.

## Why This Matters for Nursing Education

**For instance**, GenAI might be used to:
- 📝 Convert lecture notes on diabetes management into **podcasts** for mobile learning
- 📊 Transform care pathway flowcharts into **explanatory narratives**
- 🎥 Turn seminar discussions about person-centred care into **visual summaries**
- 🖼️ Create **anatomical diagrams** from text descriptions

This ability to work fluidly across modes introduces new opportunities for nursing educators to make complex clinical concepts more tangible, and to design learning experiences that better accommodate the diversity of students' learning preferences and needs.

## The Role of GenAI

In a multimodal teaching-learning environment, GenAI allows educators to move decisively beyond text-dominant approaches:

### What GenAI Can Do:

- **Text-to-image and text-to-video tools** can generate diagrams, animations, and explanatory visuals in minutes
- **Audio synthesis** can create narrated explainers or podcasts to accompany slides  
- **Large language models** can rapidly produce draft quiz questions, scenario descriptions, or alternative explanations pitched at different levels of complexity

**The role of GenAI in this context is best understood as amplification rather than substitution** — it does not replace the pedagogical expertise or creativity of educators, but instead augments their capacity to respond flexibly to students' needs.

:::tip Key Principle
Educators can focus on higher-order aspects of teaching such as sequencing, framing, and critical discussion, while delegating lower-level production tasks to AI. This shift enables more responsive and iterative teaching design.
:::

## Critical and Ethical Orientation

At the same time, embedding GenAI into multimodal teaching demands a critical and ethical orientation:

:::caution Important Considerations
- **AI-generated outputs are shaped by their training datasets** — they may reproduce biases, inaccuracies, or stereotypes
- **Educators have a dual responsibility**:
  1. Model critical interrogation of AI outputs in their own teaching practice
  2. Scaffold students' ability to do the same
:::

This is especially vital where AI is used to represent nursing knowledge visually or narratively, as inaccuracies can be less immediately visible than in text.

**For nursing specifically**:
- Verify clinical information against NICE guidelines, NMC standards, Cochrane reviews
- Check anatomical diagrams for accuracy
- Review patient scenarios for realistic and ethical representation
- Ensure cultural sensitivity in generated content

## Equity and Sustainability

Considerations of equity and sustainability must also inform multimodal AI use:

- **Access to high-quality AI tools is uneven** across institutions and student populations
- **Premium features are often gated behind paywalls**
- **Image and video generation carry significant computational and environmental costs**

**Therefore**: Purposeful adoption is essential, ensuring that multimodal AI is used where it genuinely enhances learning rather than as a novelty.

## Future-Facing Skills

Integrating GenAI into multimodal teaching also creates opportunities to develop future-facing skills. As healthcare increasingly demands fluency in interpreting, critiquing, and collaborating with AI-generated content, students benefit from encountering these practices within their studies.

:::tip Best Practice
Educators who intentionally model transparent AI use—explaining prompts, evaluating outputs, and reflecting on limitations—can nurture these literacies while simultaneously enriching disciplinary teaching.
