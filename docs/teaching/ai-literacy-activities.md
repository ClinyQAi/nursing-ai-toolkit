Developing AI literacy requires practice. Below are three ready-to-use activities mapped to the literacy levels defined in the [AI Literacy](./../ai-literacy/index.md) section.

## Activity 1: "Critique the Output" (Intermediate)
**Goal**: Develop critical evaluation skills and domain knowledge verification.

*   **Setup**: The educator generates a care plan using a standard LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) for a complex patient (e.g., "75yo with Dementia and Type 1 Diabetes"). **Intentionally** do not fact-check it.
*   **Task**: Students work in small groups to "grade" the AI's care plan.
*   **Checklist for Students**:
    *   Is the clinical information accurate?
    *   Is the tone person-centred?
    *   Does it align with UK guidelines (NICE)?
    *   **Crucially**: Identify one dangerous or vague suggestion.
*   **Feedback**: Discuss as a class. Highlight that *subject matter expertise* determines the quality of AI use.

## Activity 2: "Prompt Refinement Relay" (Advanced)
**Goal**: Teach prompt engineering and iterative improvement.

*   **Setup**: Students have a complex task: "Create a plain-English explanation of the Mental Capacity Act for a teenager."
*   **Round 1**: Student A writes a simple prompt. Records the output.
*   **Round 2**: Student B critiques the output and writes an *improved* prompt (adding context, persona, constraints). Records output.
*   **Round 3**: Student C refines it further targeting a specific tone.
*   **Review**: Compare the generic output (Round 1) with the refined output (Round 3). Discuss *what* specific instructions changed the result.

## Activity 3: "The Ethics Audit" (Basic/Intermediate)
**Goal**: Understand data privacy and ethical bias.

*   **Scenario**: "You need to write a handover summary for a patient, 'Sarah Jones', DOB 12/05/1980, NHS Number 123 456 789."
*   **Task**: Ask students to draft a prompt to get AI to help with this.
*   **The Trap**: See if any students include the PII (Name, NHS number) in the chat interface.
*   **Teachable Moment**: Stop the class. Discuss **why** we never input real patient data. Show how to anonymize: "Patient X, 45yo female..."
*   **Extension**: Discuss bias. Ask AI to generate an image of "A nurse leader". Audit the results for gender/ethnicity representation.
