# 🧪 Prompt Playground (BETA)

Welcome to the **Prompt Playground**, a conceptual space for building and testing nursing-specific AI prompts.

:::warning Under Construction
This is a "Low-Fidelity" interactive guide. In the future, we plan to integrate a live AI testing interface directly into this page.

## 🧩 The Nursing Prompt Anatomy

To get the most accurate clinical reasoning from an AI, use the **C.R.E.A.T.E.** framework:

-   **C**ontext: Who are you? (e.g., "I am a Year 2 student nurse")
-   **R**ole: Who should the AI be? (e.g., "Act as a clinical educator")
-   **E**xpectation: What is the task? (e.g., "Explain the mechanism of Warfarin")
-   **A**udience: Who is the output for? (e.g., "For a 10-year-old child")
-   **T**one: What style do you need? (e.g., "Simple, empathetic, and reassuring")
-   **E**vidence: What standards should it follow? (e.g., "Based on UK BNF guidelines")

## 🏗️ Prompt Builder (Visual Guide)

Use the blocks below to assemble your prompt. Copy and paste the results into your preferred AI (Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini).

### Step 1: Set the Persona
> "You are a **[Senior Charge Nurse]** with 20 years of experience in **[Emergency Care]**."

### Step 2: Define the Task
> "I need you to help me prepare for a **[Viva Voce assessment]** regarding **[Sepsis recognition]**."

### Step 3: Set the Constraints
> "Focus strictly on **[NEWS2 scoring]** and do not provide medical advice. Use **[person-centred language]** throughout."

## 🧪 Try These "Golden Prompts"

### 1. The Concept Simplifier
*Use this when a textbook definition isn't clicking.*
```text
I am a nursing student struggling to understand [CONCEPT, e.g., Osmosis]. 
Explain this to me using a nursing-specific metaphor (like IV fluids or 
blood pressure). Avoid jargon and use a conversational tone.
```

### 2. The Clinical Socratic Tutor
*Use this to test your own knowledge.*
```text
Act as a Socratic tutor. I want to practice my understanding of [NMC 
PROFICIENCY, e.g., Medication Management]. Do not give me the answers. 
Instead, ask me one challenging clinical question at a time and wait 
for my response before providing feedback and the next question.
```

## 🚀 The Future of the Playground

In Version 2.0 of this toolkit, we aim to include:
- ✅ **Live API Integration**: Test prompts directly on this page.
- ✅ **Prompt Library Search**: A searchable database of community-submitted prompts.
- ✅ **One-Click Copy**: Buttons to instantly copy prompts to your clipboard.
