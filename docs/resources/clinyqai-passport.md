## 🏛️ The 5 Domains of AI Stewardship

The passport is organized into five critical domains derived from Health Education England (HEE) and NMC standards:

### 1. 🛡️ Clinical Quality & Safety
Focuses on "High-Stakes" AI usage. Can you use AI safely to detect patient deterioration, verify drug calculations, or manage sepsis response bundles?

### 2. 🧠 AI Reasoning & Criticality
The core of "Digital Resilience." Can you identify AI hallucination, manage bias, and critically appraise the evidence AI provides?

### 3. 💬 Relational Intelligence
Using AI to enhance, not replace, the human element. Master difficult conversations, de-escalation, and complex family history taking through simulation.

### 4. ⚖️ Ethical Accountability
Understanding the professional implications of AI. This covers data privacy, ethical dilemmas, and maintaining "Human-in-the-loop" accountability.

### 5. ⚙️ Clinical Productivity
Efficiency without compromising quality. Learn to use AI for SBAR handovers, clinical documentation assistance, and care planning.
