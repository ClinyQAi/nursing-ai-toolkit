Framework

Child Nursing

The NMC Competency Framework

The NMC Standards for pre-registration nursing education (2010) set out the standards for

competence and the related competencies that every nursing student must acquire before

applying to be registered at first level on the nurses’ part of the register. The assessment of

practice requirements set out in this document reflects the field specific and generic

competencies set out in the NMC Standards for pre-registration nursing education (2010).

The full version of the NMC generic and field specific competencies can be accessed via the

DVD in the Placement Support Resource Pack which accompanies this assessment of

practice document and these can also be viewed via the DPL web site.

The generic standards for competence focus on four domains and are reproduced below as

they appear in the NMC Standards.

Domain 1: Professional Values

All nurses must act first and foremost to care for and safeguard the public. They must

practise autonomously and be responsible and accountable for safe, compassionate,

person-centred, evidence-based nursing that respects and maintains dignity and human</div><div class="cardActions_ZBOr"><button class="actionButton_JG9F">✨ Generate AI Prompt</button></div></div><div class="resultCard_Kwrk"><div class="cardContent_HIdS">practise autonomously and be responsible and accountable for safe, compassionate,

person-centred, evidence-based nursing that respects and maintains dignity and human

rights. They must show professionalism and integrity and work within recognised

professional, ethical and legal frameworks. They must work in partnership with other health

and social care professionals and agencies, service users, their carers and families in all

settings, including the community, ensuring that decisions about care are shared.

Domain 2: Communication and interpersonal skills

All nurses must use excellent communication and interpersonal skills. Their communications

must always be safe, effective, compassionate and respectful. They must communicate

effectively using a wide range of strategies and interventions including the effective use of

communication technologies. Where people have a disability, nurses must be able to work

with service users and others to obtain the information needed to make reasonable

adjustments that promote optimum health and enable equal access to services.

Domain 3: Nursing practice and decision-making

All nurses must practise autonomously, compassionately, skilfully and safely, and must

maintain dignity and promote health and wellbeing. They must assess and meet the full

range of essential physical and mental health needs of people of all ages who come into

their care. Where necessary they must be able to provide safe and effective immediate care

to all people prior to accessing or referring to specialist services irrespective of their field of

practice. All nurses must also meet more complex and coexisting needs for people in their

own nursing field of practice, in any setting including hospital, community and at home. All

practice should be informed by the best available evidence and comply with local and

national guidelines. Decision-making must be shared with service users, carers and families

and informed by critical analysis of a full range of possible interventions, including the use of

up-to-date technology. All nurses must also understand how behaviour, culture,</div><div class="cardActions_ZBOr"><button class="actionButton_JG9F">✨ Generate AI Prompt</button></div></div><div class="resultCard_Kwrk"><div class="cardContent_HIdS">and informed by critical analysis of a full range of possible interventions, including the use of

up-to-date technology. All nurses must also understand how behaviour, culture,

socioeconomic and other factors, in the care environment and its location, can affect health,

illness, health outcomes and public health priorities and take this into account in planning

and delivering care.

Domain 4: Leadership, management and team working

All nurses must be professionally accountable and use clinical governance processes to

maintain and improve nursing practice and standards of healthcare. They must be able to

respond autonomously and confidently to planned and uncertain situations, managing

themselves and others effectively. They must create and maximise opportunities to improve

services. They must also demonstrate the potential to develop further management and

leadership skills during their period of preceptorship and beyond.

Examples of Suggested Method of Assessment

Accompanying each proficiency is some examples of potential / suggested methods of assessment that could be utilised to evidence the completion of a specific proficiency. For some proficiencies, there may only be one method of assessment. For example: “Demonstrates effective hand washing” can only be completed using direct observation, which is due to the nature of the skill being assessed. However, for some, there are various ways to evidence completion of the proficiency. Alternatively, it may be useful to consider a spoke placement if there is limited exposure to the proficiency in the practice learning environment.

The various methods of assessment include:

• • • •

The nursing procedures that a newly registered nurse must be able to demonstrate in order to meet the proficiency outcomes, outlined in the main body of this document, are set out in this annexe.

“At the point of registration, the registered nurse will be able to safely demonstrate the following procedures.”

clearly show the existence or truth of (something) by giving proof or evidence (PAD, reflection etc)

“The nursing procedures within this annexe are set out in two sections. These requirements are relevant to all fields of nursing practice although it is recognised that different care settings may require different approaches to the provision of care. It is expected that these procedures would be assessed in a student’s chosen field of practice where practicable.”

Practicable = able to be done or put into practice successfully.

Therefore, acknowledgement should be made that some learning and assessment opportunities will be circumstantial (patients at that time, services being delivered and learning environment) and different assessment methods would be appropriate and relevant to use in achievement of these procedures (not proficiencies).

Registered nurses in all fields of practice must demonstrate the ability to provide nursing intervention and support for people of all ages who require nursing procedures during the processes of assessment, diagnosis, care and treatment for mental, physical, cognitive and behavioural health challenges.

Acknowledgement and understanding that although nursing students all have to demonstrate (see above) the ability to provide nursing interventions, the level of this ability will differ depending on their chosen field(s) of study.

Therefore, consideration must be made by Practice Supervisors/Assessor and adapt their learning and assessment criteria.</div><div class="cardActions_ZBOr"><button class="actionButton_JG9F">✨ Generate AI Prompt</button></div></div><div class="resultCard_Kwrk"><div class="cardContent_HIdS">Therefore, consideration must be made by Practice Supervisors/Assessor and adapt their learning and assessment criteria.

Those procedures outlined in Annexe B, Part I: Procedures for assessing needs for person-centred care, sections 1 and 2 also apply to all registered nurses, but the level of expertise and knowledge required will vary depending on the chosen field(s) of practice. Registered nurses must therefore be able to demonstrate the ability to undertake these procedures at an appropriate level for their intended field(s) of practice.

What does proficiency mean in this context

The ability to demonstrate the knowledge, skills and professional values required for safe practice in accordance with the Part of programme and assessment criteria whilst practicing within the clinical governance requirement of the learning environment and organisation.

Relates to the year the learner is studying in.

A recommendation for progression should be made when the student comes to point at which they will progress from one Part of the course to the next.

Learning experiences and opportunities What are learning opportunities for learning in,

There are a number of different learning experiences that can be delivered within learning environments, using different methods such as group learning, one to one learning, peer to peer learning, classroom learning, simulation and direct patient care.

and for, practice.</div><div class="cardActions_ZBOr"><button class="actionButton_JG9F">✨ Generate AI Prompt</button></div></div><div class="resultCard_Kwrk"><div class="cardContent_HIdS">and for, practice.

Learning experiences do not need to be confined within a particular environment, or to a particular episode of care. A learning experience can follow a person’s episode or experience of care and can involve a leaner being assigned to a service user throughout their treatment or care, across environments. Learning can be organised in lots of different ways. For example, group or one to one supervised learning, providing direct care, simulated activity, or independent or self-directed learning.

Simulation is another way of creating a learning experience and it can and should be used in learning and assessment strategies. Simulation should not be used as an end in itself but should be appropriately integrated in a blended approach to learning, and implemented to address specific learning or clinical needs.

Suggested Approach

“Together these standards aim to provide approved education institutions (AEIs) and their practice learning partners with the flexibility to develop innovative approaches to education for nurses, midwives and nursing associates, while being accountable for the local delivery and management of approved programmes in line with our standards.”

Acknowledgement that health and social care services often require a flexible approach to service delivery, and this is the same for facilitation of learners.

NMC acknowledge this and their 2018 Standards allow for flexible approaches to be utilised in line with their Standards.
