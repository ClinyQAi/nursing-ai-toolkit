# 🗺️ NMC Proficiency Mapping Tool

Align your use of Generative AI with the **NMC Standards of Proficiency for Registered Nurses (2018)**. This tool helps you:

1.  **Select** relevant Platforms, Annexe A, or Annexe B proficiencies for your teaching activity.
2.  **Discover** AI strategies specifically mapped to each domain.
3.  **Generate** a formatted compliance statement for your module descriptor or lesson plan.

:::info Why does this matter?
UK Higher Education Institutions require lecturers to demonstrate how learning activities map to NMC standards. This tool makes that process faster and more transparent, while also ensuring AI use is educationally justified.
