---

## Abstract

**Background:** The rapid integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into healthcare and education presents both opportunities and challenges for nurse educators. While AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot offer potential for enhancing teaching, many educators lack practical guidance on their responsible and effective application within nursing curricula.

**Aims:** This article introduces an open-source, web-based resource—the *AI in Nursing Education: A Multimodal Learning Toolkit*—designed specifically for UK nurse educators. The toolkit provides evidence-based strategies, practical case studies, and ready-to-use AI prompts aligned with Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) standards and Royal College of Nursing (RCN) digital literacy frameworks.

**The Toolkit:** The resource covers three core domains: Teaching with AI, Supporting Self-Regulated Learning, and AI-Resilient Assessment. It also introduces the concept of 'Relational AI'—using AI not merely for information retrieval, but for facilitating reflective practice and person-centred communication, grounded in the work of the Foundation of Nursing Studies (FoNS).

**Implications for Practice:** By equipping nurse educators with practical skills and a critical lens, this toolkit supports the development of digitally literate, ethically aware nursing graduates ready for contemporary practice.

## Introduction

The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has fundamentally altered the landscape of healthcare education. Tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot can generate text, images, audio, and even basic clinical content with unprecedented ease (Sallam, 2023). For nursing students, AI offers new ways to study, revise, and engage with complex clinical scenarios. For educators, it presents both an opportunity to innovate and a challenge to maintain the integrity and person-centredness that underpin nursing practice.

Despite growing interest, many nurse educators report feeling underprepared to integrate AI into their teaching (Buchanan et al., 2024). Concerns range from academic misconduct to the potential for AI to perpetuate biases or erode critical thinking skills. Furthermore, generic AI guidelines often fail to address the unique ethical and relational demands of nursing education.

This article introduces the *AI in Nursing Education: A Multimodal Learning Toolkit*—an open-access, web-based resource developed specifically for UK nursing educators. The toolkit provides practical strategies, case studies, and ready-to-use prompts, all grounded in the Nursing and Midwifery Council's (NMC) standards, the Royal College of Nursing's (RCN) digital literacy guidance, and the person-centred principles championed by the Foundation of Nursing Studies (FoNS).

## Development and Grounding

### Alignment with Professional Standards

The toolkit was developed with explicit reference to several key professional frameworks:

- **NMC Standards for Student Supervision and Assessment (2018):** The resource emphasises the role of the educator in modelling responsible AI use and maintaining oversight of technology-assisted learning.
- **NMC Future Nurse Standards (2018):** Competencies related to digital literacy and evidence-based practice are embedded throughout.
- **RCN Digital Literacy Guidance (2023):** The toolkit draws on RCN recommendations for developing digital skills in nursing, including critical appraisal of online information and awareness of data privacy.

### The Nurse Citizen Developer Movement

A guiding philosophy of this project is the concept of the 'Nurse Citizen Developer'—the idea that nurses should actively shape the digital tools they use, rather than passively accepting solutions designed by others (Gombedza, 2024). This ethos is reflected in the toolkit's emphasis on prompt engineering (crafting effective AI instructions), critical evaluation of AI outputs, and the inclusion of open-source, community-contributed case studies.

### Collaboration with the Foundation of Nursing Studies

The toolkit integrates resources and principles from the Foundation of Nursing Studies (FoNS), including:

- **Person-Centred Nursing Framework (McCormack and McCance, 2017):** Used to guide discussions on using AI to enhance, rather than replace, relational care.
- **International Practice Development Journal (IPDJ) Archive:** Open-access research articles are recommended as 'grounding texts' for AI-facilitated learning.
- **Creating Caring Cultures Programme:** The toolkit signposts FoNS resources for students and educators seeking to develop person-centred workplace cultures.

## The Toolkit: Core Components

The *AI in Nursing Education Toolkit* is structured around three core domains, each addressing a key aspect of the educational experience.

### 1. Teaching with AI

This section equips educators with strategies for using GenAI in their teaching practice.

**Visual Content Creation:** Educators can use multimodal AI (e.g., Google Gemini, DALL-E) to generate anatomical diagrams, patient education materials, and simulation aids. The toolkit provides specific prompts for creating culturally diverse and clinically accurate visuals, addressing the well-documented issue of skin tone bias in medical imagery (Adamson and Smith, 2018).

**Simulation and Case Studies:** AI can generate realistic patient scenarios for classroom discussion or simulation-based learning. The toolkit includes a library of prompts for creating scenarios involving history-taking, deteriorating patients, and ethical dilemmas. Each prompt is accompanied by guidance on validating AI-generated content for clinical accuracy.

**Multilingual Resources:** For educators working with multilingual cohorts or on global health placements, the toolkit demonstrates how AI can translate and adapt patient information leaflets while preserving cultural sensitivity.

### 2. Supporting Self-Regulated Learning

GenAI offers significant potential as a 'study companion' for nursing students—provided it is used critically.

**Personalised Revision:** Students can use AI to generate practice questions, explain complex concepts in simpler terms, or create flashcards. The toolkit provides sample prompts and warns against over-reliance, emphasising the need for verification against authoritative sources.

**Just-in-Time Support:** AI can offer 'just-in-time' explanations of clinical terminology or procedures, supporting students on placement. The toolkit includes guidance on using AI safely in practice settings, with clear boundaries around patient data and confidentiality.

**Metacognition and Reflection:** A distinctive feature of the toolkit is its focus on using AI to support reflective practice. Students are guided to use AI as a 'thinking partner'—asking it to challenge assumptions, suggest alternative perspectives, or scaffold Gibbs' Reflective Cycle.

### 3. AI-Resilient Assessment

The rise of GenAI has prompted significant concern about academic integrity. The toolkit addresses this head-on, advocating for assessment redesign rather than surveillance.

**Designing Out AI Misuse:** The toolkit provides practical strategies for creating assessments that are inherently resistant to AI misuse. These include:
- Assessments requiring integration of personal placement experience.
- Viva or oral components.
- Reflective portfolios linked to specific clinical encounters.
- Process-focused assessments (e.g., demonstrating iterative drafting).

**Acknowledging AI Use:** Rather than banning AI outright, the toolkit recommends clear institutional policies on acceptable use, with students expected to declare and reflect on their use of AI tools.

**AI-Assisted Feedback:** Educators can use AI to generate formative feedback or mark initial drafts, freeing time for more substantive, relational interactions with students. The toolkit provides prompts for this purpose, with caveats on the need for human oversight.

## Relational AI: A New Paradigm

Beyond its practical applications, the toolkit introduces a conceptual framework termed 'Relational AI'.

### What is Relational AI?

Relational AI is an approach to using artificial intelligence that prioritises the relational aspects of nursing—empathy, compassion, and person-centredness—over purely transactional outputs. It moves AI from being a tool that simply generates answers to one that helps nurses reflect on their practice.

This concept draws on the work of FoNS and the Person-Centred Nursing Framework (McCormack and McCance, 2017). AI, while incapable of genuine empathy, can simulate reflective dialogue, prompting students to examine their own communication styles, biases, and values.

### Practical Applications

**Person-Centred Language Checker:** The toolkit includes prompts and guidance for using AI to review care documentation for jargon, institutional language, or depersonalising phrasing. Students learn to translate 'Medicalese' into accessible, person-centred language.

**Simulated Clinical Supervision:** AI can be prompted to act as a clinical supervisor, using Socratic questioning to guide students through reflective debriefs. This is particularly useful for distance learners or those without immediate access to a practice educator.

**Values Clarification:** Students can explore ethical dilemmas by conversing with AI, using it as a sounding board for their own values and assumptions before discussing with peers or educators.

## Case Studies: Practical Application

The toolkit includes a growing library of case studies developed by nursing educators and students.

### Case Study 1: Wound Care Visualisation

An educator used Google Gemini to generate images of pressure ulcers at different stages, specifically requesting diverse skin tones. The AI-generated images were then critiqued in class, with students identifying limitations (e.g., inconsistent lighting, unrealistic depth) and comparing them to validated clinical photography.

**Learning Outcome:** Students developed critical appraisal skills while addressing skin tone bias in clinical education.

### Case Study 2: History-Taking Simulation

A cohort of adult nursing students used ChatGPT to simulate patient interviews. Each student 'interviewed' an AI-generated patient persona, then swapped with a peer to critique the AI's responses.

**Learning Outcome:** Students recognised both the utility and limitations of AI for communication practice, noting that AI often 'broke character' or provided overly cooperative responses.

### Case Study 3: Person-Centred Care Planning

Using the Relational AI prompts, a student nurse submitted a draft care plan to ChatGPT for person-centred language review. The AI identified phrases such as "non-compliant" and suggested alternatives focused on patient agency and choice.

**Learning Outcome:** The student developed awareness of institutional language and its impact on care relationships.

## Discussion: The Human in the Loop

### Ethical Considerations

The toolkit is underpinned by a commitment to responsible AI use. Key ethical themes include:

- **Bias and Equity:** AI models are trained on data that may reflect historical biases. The toolkit encourages educators and students to critically appraise AI outputs for cultural, gender, or racial bias.
- **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Clear guidance is provided on never entering real patient data into public AI systems. Synthetic or fictional scenarios are recommended for all educational activities.
- **Academic Integrity:** The toolkit advocates for transparency, with students expected to declare and reflect on AI use in assessed work.

### The Role of the Nurse

A central message of the toolkit is that AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgement. The nurse—whether student or educator—remains the 'human in the loop', responsible for verifying, contextualising, and applying AI-generated content.

This aligns with the NMC Code (2018), which emphasises that registered nurses must use the best available evidence and exercise professional judgement in all aspects of care.
