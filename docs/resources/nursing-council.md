# ⚖️ Nursing Council Agent

The **Nursing Council Agent** is an innovative AI tool designed to simulate a professional peer review panel. It leverages the "**Council of Models**" approach to provide nursing educators with comprehensive, balanced feedback on their lesson plans, clinical scenarios, or curriculum materials.

Instead of a single AI response, the Council convenes three distinct "experts" to review your work from different angles.

:::info Aligned with UK Standards
The agent's personas are specifically tuned to align with **UK Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Standards** and person-centred care principles.

## 🎭 The Council Members

The agent evaluates your content through three primary perspectives:

1.  **🎓 The Academic**: Focuses on pedagogical rigor, NMC standards alignment, and evidence-based practice.
2.  **🏥 The Clinical Mentor**: Focuses on ward-level realism, clinical applicability, and student safety.
3.  **👩‍🎓 The Student Advocate**: Focuses on clarity, accessibility, and the student's learning experience.

The **Chairman** then synthesizes these views into a final, actionable report.

## 🚀 How to Use It

1.  **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Click the **Settings (⚙️)** icon within the tool above to add your own API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or DeepSeek).
2.  **Input Your Content**: Paste your lesson plan or clinical scenario into the text area.
3.  **Run the Council**: Click "Run Review" and watch the discussion unfold.
4.  **Export Feedback**: You can download the final synthesis as a PDF report for your records.
