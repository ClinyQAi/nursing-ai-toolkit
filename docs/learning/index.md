This section shifts the focus from **teaching delivery** to **student learning**. It explores how nursing students can use Generative AI responsibly as a "24/7 Personal Tutor" to support their academic and clinical growth.

## The Shift: From Passive Consumer to Active Co-Pilot
Traditionally, students consume resources created by educators. With GenAI, students can create their own bespoke learning materials. This requires **Self-Regulated Learning (SRL)** skills.

### Key Concepts for Students
1.  **Metacognition**: "Do I understand this?" -> Using AI to quiz one's own knowledge gaps.
2.  **Agency**: Taking control of *how* material is presented (e.g., "Explain this to me like I'm 5").
3.  **Critical Verification**: Never trusting the AI blindly, especially for clinical facts.

## In This Section

### [Personalised Learning](./personalised-learning)
How to use AI to adapt content to your learning style, simplify complex concepts, and create "personas" for your digital tutor.

### [Just-in-Time Support](./just-in-time-support)
Using AI for immediate performance support, checking guidelines, and revising procedures—with critical safety warnings.

### [Multimodal Creation](./multimodal-creation)
Strategies for students to create their own revision assets, including flashcards, podcasts, and mind maps.

### [Nursing Examples & Prompts](./nursing-examples)
A library of prompt templates designed specifically for nursing students to copy and use safely.

:::warning Clinical Safety
**For Students**: AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini are **not** medical devices. They can "hallucinate" (make up) drug dosages, guidelines, and pathophysiology.
**ALWAYS** verify clinical information against authoritative sources (BNF, Royal Marsden Manual, NICE).
