"Just-in-Time" support refers to accessing knowledge exactly when you need it—for example, whilst preparing for a placement shift or revising a specific procedure.

:::danger CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING
**NEVER** use public AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) as a primary reference for:
*   Drug Dosages (Use BNF)
*   Local Trust Policy (Use Intranet)
*   Resuscitation Algorithms (Use Resus Council UK)

AI models are probabilistic, not databases. They can and do make up numbers.

## Safe Use Cases

### 1. Revision of Procedures
Before a clinical skills session, use AI to visualize the steps.
> **Prompt**: "List the sequential steps for Aseptic Non-Touch Technique (ANTT) for a simple wound dressing. Highlight the key points where contamination risk is highest."

### 2. Pharmacology Mechanisms
Use AI to understand *how* a drug works (Pharmacodynamics), rather than the dose.
> **Prompt**: "Explain how Furosemide works in the Loop of Henle to reduce edema."

### 3. Understanding Medical Abbreviations
> **Prompt**: "What might 'TDS', 'BD', and 'PRN' stand for in a prescription context? potential ambiguities?"

## The "Traffic Light" Protocol for Students
Teach students to categorize their queries:

*   🔴 **RED (Stop)**: Calculations, Dosages, life-critical policies. **DO NOT USE AI. Use specific tools.**
*   🟡 **AMBER (Careful)**: Disease symptoms, care plans, broad guidelines. **USE AI + VERIFY.**
*   🟢 **GREEN (Go)**: Explanations of concepts, communication roleplay, formatting text. **USE AI FREELY.**
