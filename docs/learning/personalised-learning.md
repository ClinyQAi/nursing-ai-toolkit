Generative AI allows students to tailor educational content to their specific needs. It acts as an "infinite patience" tutor that can re-explain concepts until they are understood.

## 1. The "Persona" Strategy
Students can instruct the AI to adopt a specific teaching persona to match their learning preference.

### Examples
*   **The Strict Professor**: "Quiz me on anatomy. Be critical. Don't let me get away with vague answers. Point out exactly where I am wrong."
*   **The Supportive Mentor**: "I'm struggling with this concept. Explain it gently and give me encouragement."
*   **The Devil's Advocate**: "I think the answer is X. Argue against me so I can strengthen my reasoning."

## 2. Adaptive Self-Quizzing
Instead of static flashcards, AI can generate dynamic quizzes based on immediate needs.

**Workflow**:
1.  **Paste Notes**: Student pastes their lecture notes into Gemini 3 Pro / Claude Sonnet 4.
2.  **Prompt**: "Test me on the key concepts in this text. Ask one question at a time. Do not move on until I answer."
3.  **Feedback**: The AI analyzes the student's answer and corrects misconceptions immediately.

## 3. "Explain Like I'm 5" (ELI5)
Nursing involves complex pathophysiology that can be overwhelming. AI is excellent at simplification.

**Prompt**:
> "Explain the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) using an analogy of a central heating system."

## 4. Converting Formats for Neurodiversity
AI can enhance accessibility by converting content formats:
*   **Text to Table**: "Convert this paragraph about side effects into a lookup table."
*   **Text to List**: "Extract the 5 key action steps from this guideline."
*   **Formatting**: "Rewrite this dense text with bold headings and short bullet points."

:::warning Verification Is Key
If you ask AI to "simplify" a concept, ensure it hasn't oversimplified to the point of clinical error. Always cross-reference with your textbook.
