Learning is most effective when students actively create content rather than just checking it. GenAI tools allow students to become creators of their own sophisticated revision materials.

## 1. Visual Revision Aids: Mind Maps
Students can use text-based LLMs to generate code for diagrams, which can be rendered in tools like Mermaid.js or Draw.io.

**Prompt**:
> "Create a Mermaid diagram code showing the flow of blood through the heart. Include valves and color-code oxygenated vs deoxygenated blood."

## 2. Audio Revision: The "Commuter Podcast"
For students with long commutes to placement, listening to revision notes is cleaner than reading.

**Workflow**:
1.  **Summarize**: Paste lecture notes into Gemini 3 / GPT-5.
2.  **Script**: "Convert these notes into a 2-person podcast script where Host A explains the concept and Host B asks clarifying questions."
3.  **Audio**: Paste the script into a text-to-speech tool (ElevenLabs, or built-in 'Read Aloud' features).

## 3. Flashcards with Images
Visual mnemonics help retention.

**Prompt**:
> "I need to remember the Cranial Nerves.
> 1. Create a table with the Name, Number, and Function.
> 2. Suggest a surreal visual image I could generate with DALL-E to remember each one (e.g., for Olfactory, a giant nose smelling a flower)."

## 4. Interactive Timelines
For History of Nursing or disease progression.

**Prompt**:
> "Create a timeline of the progression of Type 1 Diabetes if untreated. Output as a markdown table."

:::tip Student Project Idea
Instead of a written essay, could students submit an **AI-assisted Portfolio** containing a podcast, a generated diagram, and a written reflection on the process?
