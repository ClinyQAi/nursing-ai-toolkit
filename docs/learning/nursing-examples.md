## 1. The "Exam Prep" Buddy
> "I am revising for my [Anatomy & Physiology] exam.
> Test me on [The Respiratory System].
> Ask me one multiple-choice question at a time.
> Wait for my answer.
> If I get it right, explain *why* it's right and move to a harder question.
> If I get it wrong, explain the correct answer simply."

## 2. The "NMC Code" Translator
> "I am reading the NMC Code (2018) section on 'Preserve Safety'.
> Give me 3 concrete, real-life examples of what this looks like on a busy ward.
> Then give me 3 examples of what a *breach* of this code would look like."

## 3. The "Communication Rehearsal"
> "I am nervous about handing over a patient to a doctor using SBAR.
> Act as a busy Junior Doctor.
> I will type my SBAR handover to you.
> Critique my handover: Was it concise? Did I miss anything critical? Did I sound professional?"

## 4. The "Drug Card" Generator
> "Create a revision card for [Amoxicillin].
> Include:
> *   Class of drug.
> *   Mechanism of Action (Simple).
> *   3 Common Side Effects.
> *   1 Critical Nursing Consideration (Safety).
> *   Format as a clean markdown table."

## 5. The "Placement Reflector"
> "I want to write a reflection on a time I felt overwhelmed on placement.
> Help me structure this using the **Driscoll Model (What? So What? Now What?)**.
> Ask me prompting questions to help me get my feelings onto the page. Do not write the reflection for me."
