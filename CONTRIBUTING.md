# Contributing to the AI Educator Toolkit

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the AI Educator Toolkit! It's people like you that make this a valuable resource for the nursing education community. 🩺✨

We welcome contributions from nurse educators, students, clinical practitioners, and educational developers.

## 🌈 Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, and all are valued:

### 1. Share a Case Study (High Impact!)
The most valuable thing you can contribute is your experience. Have you used AI in a clinical simulation? To help students understand a complex concept? As an assessment tool? 
- Use our [Case Study Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/case-study-submission.md).
- Focus on the *process*, the *NMC alignment*, and the *lessons learned*.

### 2. Improve Documentation
- Fix a typo.
- Clarify a confusing sentence.
- Suggest a better analogy for a nursing concept.

### 3. Share a "Golden Prompt"
Do you have a prompt that works exceptionally well for generating care plans or clinical scenarios? Share it in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ClinyQAi/-AI-Educator-Toolkit/discussions).

### 4. Technical Improvements
If you're tech-savvy, you can help improve the Docusaurus site structure, design, or accessibility.
